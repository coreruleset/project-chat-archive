<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's time!</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:30:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good night everyone! :wave:</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:30:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Welcome to our December Monthly chat :party-crs:</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:30:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi there!</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">For all that didn't had the time to check it out, this is our agenda: [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3950](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3950)</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">For the sake of time, I'm not going to repeat everything we have there, but I'll bring some of the points.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">First one: considering I'll be leading the agenda of the monthly meetings, and it is officially in the middle of my working day, I can reserve 1:30 in my calendar. It might be less sometimes.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi all</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OWASP announced that load balancer vendor and CRS integrator SKUDONET are now an OWASP "Silver Start-Up Corporate Supporter". They assigned 10% of their supporter donation to the CRS prohect! I've reached them to say thank you, and invite them for our next year's CRS day in Barcelona and/or Washington DC.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anybody know how their integration look like? Like architecture? Unique selling points?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Seems like it is _pound_ based.</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">just fyi...</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I've browser their site a bit.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But I hope they can be around in the next user day to present/talk about their setup and settings.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">On the rules front: we have our new v4.9.0 release which brings a new variable for disabling response rules.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:59 UTC</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's very welcome with the response rules.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Did anybody reach out to theMiddle?</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I did</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm in the middle of doing it</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I did</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">About the response rules (or mime type stuff)?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">no, about his blog post</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Both were blog posts</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">and modsecurity's multipart parser</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I talked to him briefly on BlueSky. But not about these topics.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">How I would love to use threads at some point.... they are so useful</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anyway</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anything you want to comment additionally on the topic?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm going to add a link to my new Chaos Fortress plugin to the agenda (-> plugin section).</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But nothing on the topic above,</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ok, moving on.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The CRS Sandbox has a new check for availability has been setup using [cronitor.io](http://cronitor.io)! See it live here: [https://owasp-crs-sandbox.cronitorstatus.com/](https://owasp-crs-sandbox.cronitorstatus.com/)</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Just added the link to the status page above in the Bookmarks</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;"></span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So at least we have a public way of knowing if things are not working</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's really useful.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Very nice!</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Security: we have some new reports to address, in particular TR7-241111.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">For the broader community, it will take some time to address, and it is not critical.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">A now it's Christian TTS (Time To Shine :tm: )</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@dune73_ is working on a new plugin named Chaos Fortress that can be used to slow down attackers by sending consistently random status codes and by delaying the response. It seems this makes automatic security scanners almost useless.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:49:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Honestly, this seems a very useful continuation of the conclusion from Cloudflare's CEO last Summer in Lisbon.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So for attackers, this will make things difficult indeed. Congrats :clap:</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sounds amazing!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you. I talked to a couple of pen-testers and they agreed this might be seriously annoying.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I see problems for client applications, if they need to make decisions based on a posible answer. But surely they must not get blocked on a tuned CRS.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Of course, if you know what you are facing, you will learn how to filter, but the security scanner is tested went bananas.
(Bananas as in "existing security weaknesses were hidden in the noise").</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There is a disclaimer to not use use as long as you have FPs. Doing that would be suicidal. But once you are past that stage, the fun part begins.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm really glad that giving you more "time free" makes you create this good stuff. Kudos. Well deserved. Now the bar is high for your next contribution :smile:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Haha.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:party-crs:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Plan is to finish this properly first.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But let's continue with the meeting.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">BTW, when are we going to talk about the future of our organisational setup? _@fzipitria_ is doing an amazing job but I don't think it's optimal that he's the only leader.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We did touch on this a bit on the retreat.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">He is working in such a frenzy now, I do not think this is sustainable much longer.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Agreed. But let's plan for this.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The dialogue is always open, and we are as usual hoping that someone will step up.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:58:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I wasn't aware that you were waiting. I've been waiting for this topic to be addressed properly since _@dune73_ told us he'd be stepping down :smile:</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:58:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Well, I'm not waiting. But we discussed a bit with _@dune73_ while at the retreat</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:58:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">For the record: The last thing I will be doing is selecting my successor. That's up to all of you.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Should I put the topic on the agenda for January?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Of course.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Excellent</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Next topic, and the one I think it might require discussion</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There is an open PR to update the documentation: [https://github.com/coreruleset/documentation/pull/137](https://github.com/coreruleset/documentation/pull/137)</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we all should devote some time to try to get that documentation effort past the finish line.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Agreed.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Andrew (sadly not here) has been overwhelmed by other stuff and probably we can split the load to make it work</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But could you summarize briefly what it's all about. I did not understand it so far.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It is a big change reorganizing how the information is being shown</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I've been trying to help there but hadn't realised that it's blocked. I'll have a look again.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">One thing that I was thinking is to setup Cloudflare Pages that will give us preview links to see how things are showing</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It will be useful for other cases (I'm thinking Alessandro), but for this case it will bring the changes more "live" instead of a bunch of diffs</span>

↳ **maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:10:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You mean for those that can't use Hugo?</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:10:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yup</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">A preview would be very helpful here.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Let me schedule then some time for that, but the main task remains there.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Who can help pushing this? I can be part of the review team, but I cannot lead on this one.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:08:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I try to help in this. I already installed a Hugo instance locally</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:09:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks. Leading the change push?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:10:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Perhaps... but I'll need some help :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:10:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'll help</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:10:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks everyone. I'll be around as usual for this. But we need more eyes.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:12:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">On the project administration front, we are glad to confirm that we have received the confirmation that Google renewed their support late for this year 2024 :party-crs: :party-crs:</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:13:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It took us a little more time than expected, but we can trust that there is a new process and Starr has been awesome in moving this forward quickly.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:14:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Starr is such a positive addition to HQ!</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:14:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">On the tools front:
> Go-ftw comes now with quantitative testing support! We have fun and interesting results in the developer retreat around this.
> We removed and will migrate useful tools that were part of the utils subdirectory as crs-toolchain sub command
</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:15:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Nice</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:16:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There is an open FP issue ([https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3926](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3926)) counting for the vast majority of FPs with CRS4 and quantitative testing now.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:17:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We have two proposals to solve it. One by _@franbuehler_, one by me. I get the feeling it would be best if we could sit together and talk it through. Maybe with support by _@maxleske_. Would that be somehting we could organize locally after xmas?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:17:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sure.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:17:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That sounds a very good reason to meet</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@Esad Cetiner_ and I have been working to improve the RCE rules to get them into a usable state for an LTS release. We're close to finishing (maybe this week).</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's awesome _@maxleske_. I was not aware you made such a good progress. _@Esad Cetiner_ is a great addition to the team.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:19:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK, I'll get in touch about the Regex meeting.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:20:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ok, now on the discussion topics.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:21:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Because _@JC_ brought this again in this channel: release cadence (again). How impactful is to make monthly releases, now that we don't commit too many PRs? Does it make sense to switch to Quarterly releases, as it was proposed?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:21:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Andrew mentioned that we discussed this already, which I agree.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:22:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But as a deference to someone that has brought up this twice in the past, I want to revisit to get this sealed.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:22:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">How much work is a release for you these days _@fzipitria_?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:23:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This is our previous discussion, btw: [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/wiki/DevRetreat23DiscussionRoadmap#release-cycle](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/wiki/DevRetreat23DiscussionRoadmap#release-cycle)</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:23:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Benefits of current cycle:
> short time to fix
> continuous practice and refinement of release process
> small release diffs with changes that can be understood quite easily (mostly)
</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:24:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Definitely that's the case :point_up_2:</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:24:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Cons of current cycle:
> amount of work?

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Amount of work is not really the case. I have most of the work automated, and I'm planning to have a release github action so we can start doing things even more automated.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:25:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So what would be the benefits of quarterly releases?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:25:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Having 4 release per year instead of 12?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:26:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Which doesn't make things too difficult if you have a deploy policy of doing things quarterly</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:26:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Instead of deploying each month, you skip 2 releases.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:26:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:shrug:</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:26:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I didn't understand why _@JC_ was pushing for this. Any idea?</span>

↳ **JC** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:51:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">sorry for being late to the party. My main point here is the number of versions out there coexisting.

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Me neither.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">He didn't explain other than what he posted</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This probably involves deployment for third parties. Or at least is my guess.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:28:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So it might be a pain for Coraza devs?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:28:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So I would say we don't change anything, and keep moving. If there is any reason to change, we need a proper explanation of advantages, etc., in a new issue.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:28:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ah, yes, coraza might be</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:28:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Because to make setup easier rules are embedded</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:29:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But I don't see that as our problem. If they want quarterly updates, then they can just skip the other releases we make.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:29:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But that can be automated</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:29:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anything that is a release in github can be automated using renovatebot.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:29:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If somebody wants to change something, they should at least open an issue and provide reasons. Jumping into a discussion bc somebody posts a link and we do not even understand the background is forthcoming, but not very useful.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:29:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Well, now he knows.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:30:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Let's move on?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:30:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:30:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:30:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">My topic in question was to reflect something that we saw while at the retreat: do we need to have two meetings per month now that we don't have the bandwidth?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:31:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I see that some of us are struggling to get time to work on the project</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:32:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Does it add to have a second meeting, where people was not able to solve what they are working on, add something to the mix?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:32:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Most of the times now, nobody is stepping up to take issues and solve them.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:32:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Other than dev-on-duty</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:33:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What I took from the retreat was the SAMM practice of running a monthly video user meeting where at least one core member attends and newbies can ask questions.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:33:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Our meetings don't work to attract newbies to the project and I see that as the biggest problem resulting in limited bandwith.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:34:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Is that the problem?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:34:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So giving up the 2nd meeting and brining up this alternative form instead with only some of us attending regularly could be beneficial.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:34:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sounds like something worth trying.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:34:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Why not... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:35:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I also get the feeling that the second meeting doesn't generate value at the moment. We could bring it back later if we feel like we need it again.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:35:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This!</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:35:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Exactly my point.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:35:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If we want to give video meetings a shot, we could start with a schedule where devs volunteer to attend some of them.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:36:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think having a call it is not a solution to the problem we are facing. But worse case, are we going to show up in a call and work on things?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:36:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We should probably shift the time as well. Or move it around across several months.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:36:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">For SAMM it's a place where newbies can ask stupid questions and see the faces of other SAMM users.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:36:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">How about we try to organise a huddle on Slack in January on the date that we _would_ have the second meeting.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:37:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would not even try to work.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:37:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anything might work. But the they stated that the video aspect is very important for the 10-40 people they see in those meeting.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:38:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Again: I agree that this is worth a try.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:38:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Do we want to start in the middle of December? Or is this a bad date? Shall we make this more public, call for people?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:38:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">How about we try to organise a huddle on Slack in January on the date that we _would_ have the second meeting.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:39:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Agree: January</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:39:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, we might want to disseminate maybe on X</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:39:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Blogpost, X, linkedin, socials, bluesky</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:40:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sounds good to me then.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:40:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Any additional last minute topic?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:41:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can take the setup if you want.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:41:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That would be awesome.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:42:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Speaking of Bluesky: I think this is getting traction. Maybe Alessandro should set up a presence there.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:42:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The concept of starter packs is quite a kickstart</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:43:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There are several OWASP starter packs around. CRS would be added to those immediately. Outside of thousands of other starter packs.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:43:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks everyone, that should do it for this last meeting of the year!</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:44:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks to _@franbuehler_ for writing the meeting notes :smile:</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:45:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">For the record, are we skipping the second meeting in December?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:46:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think so, yes?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:47:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes. We are skipping the second meeting in December</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:47:34 UTC</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:48:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks, just checking :slightly_smiling_face:

Enjoy your holidays, everyone!</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:49:11 UTC</span>

**JC** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:51:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">sorry for being late to the party. My main point here is the number of versions out there coexisting. At least from coraza side, we are not yet done with 3.x and we are already asked to upgrade to 3.(x+2). We have to deal with testing across several connectors/runtimes and FTW so it is a big burden ATM. All that said I am not aware of the statistics of concurring version usage and also the need of releasing minors every month.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">At least from my point of view it's important for us to release often, because the changes in CRS are always complex. Cutting them into releases makes them easier to handle (IMO).

I don't believe that it's crucial for Coraza to support every single version. Quarterly updates might be enough, and users can probably compile their own if they wanted to update to a minor in between.</span>
