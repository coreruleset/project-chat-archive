**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hello!</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey ho!</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good evening</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello everybody. Good to see you all.</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hello :wave:</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi all!</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Evening all</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi _@emphazer_. hello _@airween_ and _@xanadu_</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Franziska is not joining tonight, she suffers from a headache... And _@walter_ is in a bit of a rush. So we try to be productive and keep this brief.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The BIG thing we only noticed today is TW is pulling out of ModSecurity.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">wow, that’s interesting!</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:wave:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We do not really know what this truely means (for us), but a lot of people have been expecting this for years and now it happens.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think someone will fork ModSec and it will continue.</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I note though that they don't intend to hand over control of code to community until 2024</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@theMiddle_ - this means the bugs will fixed before the Mars landing... :smile:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">is there an official blog post or link about this?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">They talk about continuing support for their rule set up to 2024. I do not know if they have commitments for providing the src code as well, but it might well be. But I reckon it will be down to security bugs.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">-> [https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/security-resources/software-updates/end-of-[…]-trustwave-support-for-modsecurity-web-application-firewall/](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/security-resources/software-updates/end-of-sale-and-trustwave-support-for-modsecurity-web-application-firewall/)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Apparently "published" on Aug 26 nobody apart from a lone sole on twitter noticed.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The best situation is is there is a new collective of people that can create a project for this</span>

**SpartanTri** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I mistyped an URI and landed at [modsec.org](http://modsec.org) today...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello _@SpartanTri_ ! Now that's a more pleasant surprise!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I will certainly try to learn more and maybe we will play a role. We're obviously the biggest community talking actively about ModSec. So we'll see and I will keep you posted.</span>

**SpartanTri** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I arrived yesterday from a long 3K drive to bring my car to Texas and today is holiday here in US, so happy to be around :D</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So that's Canada to Texas?</span>

**SpartanTri** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:38:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Left the car at the first airport in NY state for a month so went to pick it up</span>

**SpartanTri** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:39:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">but my agenda seems better here so will start looking to my favourite project stuff again</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:39:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Splendid news. Good have you working on the project again. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:39:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Before we continue (not worth talking about TW anymore I guess since we know so little) ...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@walter_ and I think it's about time _@Paul Beckett_, _@maxleske_ and _@xanadu_ add their names to the CONTRIBUTORS.md file. We're very happy to have you on the project and your contributions live a big and positive footprint in our repo.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">s/live/leave/</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">welcome to all, guys! :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">thanks :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">thanks</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you! :smile:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You're all most welcome. And thank you. It's very nice for us to run a growing community project and with you joining we're more than ten active developers and that's just amazing!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@xanadu_ has also published a very interesting article on expanding ModSec.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">[https://www.loadbalancer.org/blog/extending-modsecurity-how-to-add-completely-custom-functionality/](https://www.loadbalancer.org/blog/extending-modsecurity-how-to-add-completely-custom-functionality/)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This reminds we of the time when I wrote that chapter for the book. It's actually really nice to do this, it's just that very few take the adventure.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The book chapter was a great guide :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you. All I contributed were a few fixes in Ivan Ristic's code. My C-knowledge is minimal. But everything compiled when I was finished (and it definitely did not in the 1st edition of the book).
There is a new fuzzing tool, we might be able to use (see link in Agenda) and I have released [https://c-rex.netnea.com](https://c-rex.netnea.com) with my company.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This is a GUI tool that brings my rule-exclusion script to the browser. C-Rex helps you (and namely your developers) to create rule exclusions and push them into CI/CD right from within the browser.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There is a video on the website and I'd be very happy to demo this for you and your teams.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But this is not meant as a sales chat, so let's get on.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Before we turn to the few PRs that we need to address, I'd like to work on the other items, since Walter needs to leave really soon.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes please :smile:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We need to fill the dev-on-duty schedule from week 39 to the end of the year.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">[https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/wiki/Dev-on-Duty](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/wiki/Dev-on-Duty)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I have announced to OWASP that we are planning to raise the weekly payments to 200 USD for dev-on-duty and add a few new obligations, but OWASP has not formally accepted. As soon as they do, we will start the higher payments.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@Paul Beckett_, _@maxleske_ and _@xanadu_: We'd be happy to join the dev-on-duty team as well. I reckon you are familiar with the program.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@SpartanTri_ you as well of course if you think you have new time to kill.</span>

↳ **SpartanTri** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Added myself for weeks 39 and 44</span>

**SpartanTri** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, let me look at the schedule and I can volunteer for some slots</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I suggest all those interested fill out the wiki during the week and if there are still gaps, I'll approach people individually.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I will be very busy for the foreseeable future so I have extended the table and picked week 45 :)</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'd like to wait, if it's ok. I have to be cautious of my mental health.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No worries _@maxleske_</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We did this with 4-5 people those last few months and if we can grow the time to 6-7 it will be relaxed.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">some weeks are also really slow with not much happening</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Kemp has paid their invoice to be our 2nd GOLD sponsor.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:partying_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So we have NGINX + Kemp Technologies on GOLD and Google AppArmor on SILVER. I plan to catch additional sponsors, but we got roughly 40K in sponsorship money.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">if we get some more sponsors then we can hire a C developer and fork modsecurity :)</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:54:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">WOW! :exploding_head:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:54:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The money is with OWASP HQ and using the money is a bit of a hassle, but we need to use it or it's going (according to OWASP). dev-on-duty is one way to spend it, our dev retreat the next one.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:54:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We should do it.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:54:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">With that much money, we need an expense policy.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OWASP has an expense policy that they are watching closely. So this gives us some guidance, but Walter and I also think we need one.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So here is a draft: [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/wiki/CRS-Expense-Policy](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/wiki/CRS-Expense-Policy)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It would be helpful if you could take a look and give us some feedback.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:56:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It is very informal, but OWASP provides the formal policy with lots of reviews. So we would like to keep it informal within CRS, so Walter and I can still react fast if we have to. We are of course very open to talk to you about plans, but we do not want to wait for formal votes, approval, the next meeting or so if we need to act quickly (-> Think TW stops developing ModSec and there are opportunities for us).</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So the idea is not to silence you. But the idea is to have a policy that says the community has a say, but the project leaders get to take a decision, but only if they agree.
AND afterwards, they still have to convince OWASP HQ and that's where the real trouble starts ...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:58:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Take your time and read it through, we're open to hear your feedback.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:58:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">to save time on the meeting, we could also revisit this issue in the chat in 2 weeks, then everybody will have had 2 weeks to read it and to mull it over in the bathroom</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">then in 2 weeks we will make it definitive</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And yes: The 250 USD limit is taken from the OWASP expense policy. Above that we need pre-approval from OWASP. Up to 250 USD, Walter and I can sign off expenses outselves.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Absolutely. Did not plan to make it definitive tonight. More introducing it and then people can discuss it in the next few weeks.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Next topic: The dev summit.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Covid numbers look bad, but so far, there is no quarantine in Switzerland for travellers and I hope nobody is introducing one for people returning from Switzerland.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So I guess we will simply continue the preparations.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Don't want to be rude but I'm also here only up to 21:30..</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">for the EU visitors, Switzerland will recognize the EU’s vaccination proofs. I would recommend to take the paper (in dutch this is the “yellow booklet”) as well as the smartphone app.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There are 1-2 people I still want to talk to, but other than that we'll be 7-10 people throughout the week. So we'll be in a great position to really get something done!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There is a list with ideas what to do at [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/wiki/Dev-Retreat-Topics](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/wiki/Dev-Retreat-Topics)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We need to structure / cut this down a bit.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Feel free to add more ideas in the meantime.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But eventually I need 1-2 people to help me form a little committee to finish / continue with the preparations.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Who wants to help me with this?</span>
