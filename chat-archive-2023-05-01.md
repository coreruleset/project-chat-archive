**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">it's just a list of todo that I'm following</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK, so here is the monthly CRS chat. Welcome everybody.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">good evening!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hello!</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:wave:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello _@airween_! Hi _@maxleske_</span>

**Matteo Pace** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good evening :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">goooood evening!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello _@walter_ and everybody. Good to see you all.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello! May Day greetings to you all.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So is May 1st a holiday where you live?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, today is a public holiday :smile:</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yep, here is it</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">here too</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Not here :disappointed:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's not really a holiday in Switzerland. But a day where protestors clash with the police in Zurich traditionally.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;"></span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ugh</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">well, a bit of a protest is not that bad.. just no Molotovs please</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's a cultural tradition that exists especially in Berlin and Zurich.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But nothing that a few PL4 rules could not solve - if there was a political will.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:38:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Let's get going with the agenda.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:39:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I have not tuned into the OWASP podcast featuring Coraza but I love the fact the project made it into the program. There is a link in the agenda.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:39:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Also in the agenda: We ranked the only student who applied. We hope he gets Google approval.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:39:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_ thinks he is really qualified.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Let's see how that works</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The fact we have only 1 applicant has to do with us (namely me) being very late with our submission of potential projects.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But if this one plays out, then it will be great.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Let’s hope so! It might finally be better to have only one good project leaning on our resources rather than multiple ones that don’t pan out</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Look over the "sub-projects" looks good. Maybe there is tendency to have an empty status for "rules" repeatedly. That's probably because this concerns everybody here - and nobody at the same time. If anybody has an idea how to fill this more consistently, then share.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Any comments or questions on the status of the sub-projects?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would like to throw a comment in on the rules.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I’m thinking we have built a huge fortress after the bug bounty, highly defensive, but we might have to change into a mode where we start trying out the main branch and see how much false positives we have introduced (and perhaps revisit rules where the false positives are unacceptable)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This resonates with what I said last month.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think there is a need to balance PL1 and PL2 (maybe event PL3).</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This is something we can do with RC2, I think.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Or do we need to do it beforehand?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think ideally we as experts should run it on some traffic in the hope of getting the worst problems sorted out, but I would also advocate for a relatively long RC2 stage, to really get people to upgrade their setups (which is already a bit of a change vs 3 due to plugins, so it may take some time before people start on this)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Agreed.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm running in PROD since October, but very little POST requests.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So I’d say, try in our group to run on live traffic -> wait a bit -> RC2 -> give it a good run of at least a month -> if RC2 requires a lot of fixes then perhaps RC3 -> a month -> release</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">there are still a lot of fps with ARGS_NAMES in PL2</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I have a large traffic customer that I have a good relationship with (and they were SQLi’d before - whole user database leaked) and I think I could convince them to try CRS 4.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Lots of POSTs.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@emphazer_, you have done a lot of FP testing lately. Is there a chance where you could run a non-scoring v4 in parallel if we shift all rule IDs into the 800K range and rename all the SecMarkers?</span>

↳ **theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">that's a fu***ng good idea to test FP!</span>

↳ **theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">why don't we release an official repo for this?</span>

↳ **theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">it would help a lot!</span>

↳ **dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's the idea with the incubator plugin actually.</span>

↳ **theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">wow.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But also already a lot of tuning present, which I released as the XenForo exclusion rules</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, we can definitely do. but first I think its important to get rid of the PL2 ARGS_NAMES problems with missing word boundaries.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Can you share a list of rules where this is a problem?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think word boundaries should be in our developers documentation - We have spent so many hours on fixing rules that trigger on long random strings.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We should think about them and use them more.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What we could do is release such a non-blocking v4 version together with RC2, so people without performance problems would be more likely to test it.</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:54:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I will try it this week. I wanted to do it last week already but wasn't possible in lack of time....</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If you find the time, an issue for each one would be very much appreciated!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It’s either us or the users who will find them :smile:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:56:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Every FP we find before the users do is less sweat and tears for n users.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Idea: We start to track who is running v4 in the wiki. So we get a better idea of the traffic it's used with before RC2 and before the release.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">is there any example application, or some honeypot app whit I can test it too? Now we have two "empty" VPS, where I can "play"...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What example are you looking for? I mean you can install any software and put CRS in front.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:58:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe it’s a good idea to pick a software that we have a plugin for?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:58:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">eg. a wordpress?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:58:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">At the other hand that does not give any data on random apps</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:58:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">sure</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Roundcube springs to mind lately.</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">okay, I see the hint :smile:</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">okay, I see the hint :smile:</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">okay, I see the hint :smile:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">More on this, or do we move on?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(move on)</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi!</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We are overwhelmed by false positives on WordPress. Unfortunately, aligning the related exclusion plugin is not always possible, and the changes we make are lost over time.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can handle it at our shop, but we have a limited number of plugins that we use - sadly sometimes a customer installs another one, especially ones that like to send JSON in params - but I’ve become very quick at writing exclusions for them</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">the problem is always that nobody use wordpress as is, and plugins do a lot of noise</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">a lot of wordpress plugin put JSON in something.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I have about 300 rules for WordPress.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm running thousands of WP sites on PL1.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If I had more time I would expand the WordPress plugin with most popular plugins, but currently it’s out of sync - We’d have to move to CRS4 first and then I can upstream a lot of my own exclusions.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I don’t know how many rules I have but I run them on PL2</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It can be done, but it’s a weekly occurrence that a customer installs a new plugin (or a plugin changes their API :sob:)</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:05:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">How can we, as a community of security experts, make a difference? (I'm serious about this)</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:05:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I mean, can we inform developers about the issue of putting JSON in cookies and URL-encoded strings?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:05:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">isn't this something that OWASP should do?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Honestly, do plugin devs care enough?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Absolutely something you can do, but I do not expect many devs to care.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That would be cool. WordPress used to require this in the past, but right now you can create hooks and post real JSON bodies.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And I reckon there are very weak offical plugin style guides...</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">if the plugin is developed by another community, perhaps they care</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we cannot teach them about security or convince them to write secure code. We need to adapt to their shit.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I’m afraid so too yes!</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:07:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">guys, is literally what OWASP do... teach dev about security :smile:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:07:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">At one time, did I suggest this? That we could tag all the rules that you get with JSON strings, and tag them JSON, and then people could ctl:ruleRemoveTargetByTag=JSON</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:08:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You can start by adding things to cheatsheets</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:08:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But in the end, this is a project. I mean, engaging and contacting the community so changes get pushed</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:08:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So who wants to lead it?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:08:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We can always try, it's just something that leaves people disillusioned pretty quickly.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:09:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I do not see CRS spend our energy on that. But I would love somebody to give it a try. If even for the most imporant 20 WP plugins.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:10:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It’s definitely on my bucket list.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:11:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Our company has to do it anyway, the knowledge is there - it’s just scattered over a lot of files and has to be properly moved into the plugin</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:11:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'd love to help on this, but is not something that a couple of guys in europe can do alone... it should be a community action</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:11:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If you want to go far, go together. So yes, it should be a community effort.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:12:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would love to do a plan for this</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:12:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">After v4?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:12:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes imho</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:13:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">uhm yes but if we start with WP plugins world maybe can be done meanwhile</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:13:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But incremental changes can always be made to the plugin - if you have time and a use case, you can do it even today</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:13:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So much stuff to do before v4, so I try to keep the todo list simple ...</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:14:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">if the v4 roadmap can live regardless the crs wp exclusion plugin, I think should not be a problem</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:15:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think so yes.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Is anybody really good with this? I usually copy & paste from existing tests ...</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:18:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Haha, me too</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:19:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We agreed that the templates were correct maybe 12 months ago. It seems the testing has changed since then but the docs were not changed</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:19:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We need to make sure the documentation is up to date and accurate.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:19:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The UA change is newer, that's for sure.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:19:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think it should be possible to add a build step to the documentation to run lint and go-ftw against the examples.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:20:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That would be a great long-term solution, but for now we need someone(s) to check the templates as they are right now.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:20:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That sounds awesome but also kind of hard</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:21:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No, shouldn't be too hard. But I can check the current examples, shouldn't be a big deal.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:21:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:21:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And also, for any future changes of how we write tests, the documentation needs to be updated going forwards. So they don't get out of sync.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:21:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes. It's kind of obvious. Do not know how we overlooked this.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:21:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's easy to do :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:21:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">In the excitement of making changes…</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:22:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Am I right, there is nothing to be said about tools section?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:22:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Nothing that I'm aware of</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:23:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I did not notice anything either.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:24:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Before we get to the project discussions, just the status: 109 issues and and 14 open PRs. The PR number is OK, the issue number is growing slowly. We are no longer closing stale issues automatically and it shows.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:24:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can make an effort and look through them, but reducing the number has to be a team effort or it will grow over our heads.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:25:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we're just blocked a little at the moment. It will pick up again</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:26:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">can we start closing all "old" issues where we ask for more information and nobody replied?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:26:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's what I would do when I look through them. But it's not too many, I am sure.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:27:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But _@maxleske_ is probably right. I just wanted to make the statement here that the number is growing (and that I was a friend of the stale-bot :slightly_smiling_face: )</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:27:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So let's move over to the project discussion.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:28:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">As you might remember I was kind of surprised we were not ready to jump onto libCoraza. Mostly for reasons that have to do with Coraza. And we postponed until today.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:28:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_ are you around or currently busy?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:28:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm always around</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:29:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Wonderful. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:29:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So talking about libcoraza now, without coraza v3 out, doesn’t make sense. Maybe next meeting is a better option, hopefully we can push v3 out in May</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:30:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The idea is that coraza is focused on getting V3 out in the next days</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What does the road map look like after that? Is the plan for Coraza v3 to be stable for years? Or is v4 around the corner and more changes again?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Is Coraza v3 "LTS"?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The idea is that per major version, no API changes will be introduced</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There is no lts in coraza.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You also said there is only a very small group of people who you think could get libCoraza into shape. Very rare skillset. Correct?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You need to know Golang, C, and CGo.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And know the details. The gore details.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And nginx on top?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">cries in Apache</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So either way, even if we wanted to, it's a bad moment to get started. Yet once v3 is out, we can get pushy?</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You can. But remember this is best effort, from a community.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:06 UTC</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:14 UTC</span>

**JC** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hahah</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Well anyways, I guess we agree, we postpone this for another month.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good, then next one. My scanner overhaul PR.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">[https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/pull/3202](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/pull/3202)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Honestly, I am not overly happy with the result, but we have close to 2K UAs that we want to block depending on the PL.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And that's a step forward. The problem is FPs and more granular list / grouping which proved close to impossible.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yet the open question is one of the sources. _@theMiddle_ thinks we can not simply take the cloudflare list, run it through a semi-manual process and then add it to our rules, since this would violate the cloudflare license. (Where did you find that license note, btw?).</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we might be able to do so from a legal standpoint since I had to look up all the patterns myself (CF only shares names of UAs, no UA strings). So it's more of an inspiration.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I don’t think that will become a problem</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No copy-pasting? It's your own work, right?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But of course this is not really a legal question. If CF is pissed with us and commercial integrators suffer, then legal action is not really concern, reputation loss is.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No copy pasting. It's more: Take list, loop over chatgtp to get UAs, check chatgtp results manually, fill in empty items manually, remove remaining empty items, add resulting list to sources list.</span>
