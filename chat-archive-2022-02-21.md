<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey, hey, it's CRS meeting time. Welcome everybody.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi there!</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi _@airween_, hello _@xanadu_. Good to see you!</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good evening</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey _@Paul Beckett_, how is it going?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:wave: all!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi there _@fzipitria_! Awesome news on the status page!</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Life is still pretty hectic here</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hello!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi _@franbuehler_, hello @walter!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I could not make it to the skiing _@franbuehler_. Saara caught Corona and then everything became a bit difficult.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh, yes! I asked myself why I did not see you there....</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hey</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey Max!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So nice to see you all again. Emphazer is on holiday and I guess _@azurIt_ is still training his daughter to go to sleep earlier. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Let's start, so we don't take too long.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So you saw that we applied for the Google Summer of Code.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">All depends on the potential students. It's bigger than previous years, so there is a chance we'll get somebody to work for us. But from what we know, the experience can be differ a lot with GSoC.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">With the Bug Bounty trial, we did not get a single report. There is going to be a meeting to sort out the WHY question on Wednesday.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">My best guess is: Serious misalignment of CRS knowhow and what elite bounty hunters want to do (-> earn money fast).</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Other than that a lot of issues have now been tagged for the 4.0.0 release.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So that's basically what stands between us and the release.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Can you all confirm that everything has been tagged?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I didn't go through everything but I've tagged the ones that came to mind</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Just reviewed all, yes. At least from the ones I think we need for v4.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I get the feeling the PRs have not been covered / tagged completely, though.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh, PRs</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">give me a sec</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ok</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Added one more</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@xanadu_: You volunteered to migrate RE packages to plugins. Is that still on your plate?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks _@fzipitria_</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can do.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">DoS rules still need moving, too.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I will do that first, I think.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If you want, you can ping me and we can look at that particular rule set together. The REs should be easy afterwards.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ok, cool.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Azurit is also very good with plugins by now.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Just in case.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">FYI: We got the first issues on the fake-bot-plugin by a user yesterday.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The lua script did not work properly with remote_ip. But I think Azurit was able to fix it.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So this start to be used.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:49:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So let's look at the issues.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">With [#2319](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#2319) (-> Scoring variables) we have found a reasonable solution I think. This took ages, but I'm really pleased with the result. Contributor Studersi has promised to provide a PR. He is aware that this will take some planning / scheduling since we need to get it merged quickly, since it affects everything.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The big backslash hunt in [#2332](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#2332).</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I did not follow this very closely. How realistic is it we get this done for 4.0?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">How soon is 4.0?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What was the date again?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I don’t think we have a date, right?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think the feature freeze is in March.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ow damn</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">MARCH?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">that’s quick</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hmm. Maybe not, then.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We can’t</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">EOM?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Or March 1st?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm not sure we had any date</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">End of March, might be workable.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can pitch in _@xanadu_, if you want</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Look up the notes: We defined it at the January meeting, but did not write it into the minutes.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks _@maxleske_. I think I need a feature change in regexp-assemble to complete the backslash issue, so help would be great :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I have mid-march for feature freeze in my head, then RC 1 in April, release in May or June.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Well, that puts some pressure. But then I can stop working on the status page if needed.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Which would be a pity, to be honest. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Should we say Feature Freeze in April then, release late June / early July?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I say: let's try to make it. If there are things that don't make the cut we can reevaluate</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But I don't like pushing things back in advance</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think that could be doable!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Max is in favor of March, you opt for April, Walter?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I am so busy my head is turning, so the mention of April made my brain jump with joy. I think we should have a somewhat long-ish RC phase too, because we have made biggest changes since 3.0 probably.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:58:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And we need to find ways to get people to run the RCs. This has been seriously lacking in the past.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:58:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yep….</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:58:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I found what we discussed in January:

[dune73](https://app.slack.com/team/UBN5JP44W)
[21:55 Uhr] What about we try to freeze by Mid-February. Or Mid-March and then 2 months to the release, roughly.


walter  [21:55 Uhr]
mid-march sounds more reasonable…


dune73  [21:55 Uhr]
And
 maybe Federico is right that we should do annual releases with a clear
rhythm instead of release "when we have all the features we want"
[21:56 Uhr] That would allow us to talk about the last features in the March issue chat and then 10 days to merge them.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">well I can run it no problem. as the CTO, if something breaks I just can say there was no reasonable way to prevent it and people can’t really talk back</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">but that won’t happen because it will be a success!</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If we can go early April, I think we’ll have better quality</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you _@franbuehler_</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We still need to write documentation for all the changes</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You mean sombody has to write the 3.3.2->4.0.0 Changelog?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Now THAT would be a GSoC project for a master student!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We need to modify the installation instructions too. A good explanation of the plugins is also essential.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And the release notes!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The plugin docs are done and ready.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, I usually get those from git, I will make sure I will put them in the RC1.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What is lacking is the early blocking and what it means for webserver configuration if you work with <Location>.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">oh my mind is not so fresh about that, I hope someone else can jump in</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I might have to do that, also because I am sitting on a perfect Early-Blocking use case to fight simple scanners!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@xanadu_ could you create an issue and assign it to me? -> Early Blocking documentation with emphasis on webserver configuration.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Early blocking mode? There's an open PR :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's cool, but probably incomplete. But let's link to that PR from the new issue. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good, so new stuff has to be merged by early April and afterwards we concentrate on regressions until the release.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:19:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I suggest we drop this for now. It's only PL2/3 after all and there are more important things to do. Also: Matomo is very stupid to work with dynamic cookie names and I hate to clean up after people doing silly things.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:21:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe it would be a good thing to have in our docs a “Compatibility” section or something, where we guide people with specific setups. For instance, we could have a Matomo page, where we explain how to exclude their cookies. We could do the same for WordPress where I rant about the various plugins (which are not covered by our RE) and give a few examples for people who want their plugins to run.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:24:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, we could expand the RE - I’m not against that, especially with WordPress. Some plugins are now really popular and I have a ton of exclusions in my private repo that I can donate to the project. The big question is where do we stop though? We should have a criterion, like: 100.000+ installs, and the plugin needs to be unabandoned, at least something, or we get swamped. (The WordPress plugin directory shows how many installs a plugin has.)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:41:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Actually, I believe it does not really have to be tied to a specific release. The recommended rules are independent from CRS so far and by providing them on our own, we bring them closer to CRS, but I think we should be able to run / optimize them on their own.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:41:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If I am correct, we could start to work on it after 4.0 is out and guide people to adopt it as we move along and improve it.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:41:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But of course it would be sweet do be done by 4.0 but I think it might be risky.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I agree</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:43:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The problem is this:
200005: Leave it intact and add new, second internal error (PCRE match limit error) detection rule in the 949xxx range/file as a scoring rule (Probably 949040; it is not really a detection rule and we want to make sure it really happens right before 949110).</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:45:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But honestly this can be done after 4.0 and if people want to roll with it, then they can always patch. (A plugin is not a solution, since the rule really has to sit between 94xxxx and 949110.)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:46:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I do not see anybody super-eager to push this at all costs, so we agree it's gone for 4.0?</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">For those interested in the perfect early blocking use case.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:24:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Step 1: Vuln scanner does HTTP request for IP address port 443. Host header numeric.
Step 2: Server catches request and redirects to application under /appl, Location header is FQDN. Redirect happens before CRS numeric host header rule has been executed (phase 2 in CRS 3.3) or the rule has triggered, but blocking only happens in phase 2 (-> CRS 3.4-dev)
Step 3: Scanner follows redirect and does a new HTTP request, this time with FQDN in the host header
Step 4: Nothing to complain about anymore for CRS

Now with early blocking enabled and anomaly threshold down to 3 (-> numeric host header rule only scores 3), the scanner would not get the redirect, but a 403 and it would be blocked.

I get so many of these numeric host header requests on the default www service on a given IP address. And I would like to block them before they continue with more and more requests. Tell them 403 and go away, fail2ban if it has to be.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I always bind default host to a dummy site that bins request which solves that particular problem</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's also a great technique!</span>
