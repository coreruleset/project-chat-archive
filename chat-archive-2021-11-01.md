<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello, hello, it's CRS time!</span>

**nerrehmit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi, I'll once again be a silent reader tonight :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:wave:</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good evening</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello, and hi _@nerrehmit_. I wonder how much longer you will get away with that. We might have a word with your boss. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi all. I am just here to say hi to you, I just got back from the hospital, my mom is not doing well and it is very serious. So I am feeling a bit drained right now and I need to take a bit of rest. Want to thank all those at the CRS retreat again for helping create a wonderful friendly atmosphere. It was my first ‘vacation’ post-covid and it was very nice to get some long missed hugs. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@Paul Beckett_ and _@xanadu_, how was your trip back from the dev retreat?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hugs for you and your mom, _@walter_!</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm still making my way back! Currently stopped near Calais overnight, and catching ferry back to UK in morning. Will definitely fly next time!</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi!!</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@walter_ sorry to hear that. Hugs and best wishes</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh wow, that's quite the trip! But your hike looked really nice.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey _@maxleske_!</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi there!</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey _@azurIt_! We missed you so dearly. Your expertise could have sped up a lot of our initiatives!</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The hike was lovely. Amazing views. I decided to take a short cut (off path) which got a little interesting but survived it</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Short cuts in the Alps are always interesting.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Every year there are people who do shortcuts on the 800m hill next to Zurich and they have to searched with helicopters in the night. Every year in the news...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Time to get started?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So our agenda is at [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2239](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2239)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Apparently, we had a great retreat with a ton of action and interesting encounters like the infamous Mr. Greisinger.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Also a lot of beer and cheese and splendid weather.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I've done a blog post that covers most of the important aspects.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There are also two links in the Agenda to other stories that might be interesting. Important is that all projects and workshops are documented in the wiki and the Agenda links all of them.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">In the merged PR section we've blown every record. Which is not surprising given the dev retreat. The largest greoup are new tests for rules that do not yet have tests. This is a necessity for the so-called "Status Page" project that we launched. We're on very good tracks there.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">See issues coreruleset issue [#2256](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#2256)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">35 merged PRs</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">5 pending PRs are related to 2256.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Then there are 10 pending PRs that need action.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I hope I can add more 3 today</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And 7 we'd like to cover tonight.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@airween_ has contributed two scripts using the msc_pyparser library to inspect the rule set: 2279 and 2277.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(only 2279 uses the parser)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">One looks for rules without tests. This can be added to our test-suite.
And the other one looks for the test with the biggest request body. This is useful to determine which limits to configure on the docker container used for testing.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oops, I thought both did.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">no prob :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Both scripts look useful and welcome to me and they do what they intend to do. We now need somebody to take a closer look and merge eventually.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Who has time to give it a go?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would like to test them. Now that Ervin explained the parser to me...</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I need few minutes to fix the 2277</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you _@franbuehler_. Please self-assign!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">2274: This is a template for PRs to guarantee that we get a minimal description and a signoff. I like this proposal a lot and I do not see anything to add. Opinions?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">LGTM</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sounds positive. Will there be a minimum length on descriptions? Some PRs eg. Role descriptions probably don't need an very long description</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">"Linting is correct". What does linting mean in this context?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">LGTM</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">s/role descriptions/test descriptions/</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would only add a mandatory limit if the descriptions continue to be lacking.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@Paul Beckett_ and _@xanadu_ would you work with _@fzipitria_ to get this merged, ideally after clearing your questions / fixing typos?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">2258: _@azurIt_ thinks the CAPEC tag for the web crawler rule in 913102 is not correct. He's probably right, but the alternative he proposes is also not quite perfect and I wonder if there is anything that covers the reconnaissance phase of an attack or if it would not be better to drop the tag here altogether.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_ confirms that the reconnaissance phase is technically part of the attack, but CAPEC does not really cover this with any separate categories, so the distinction is maybe a bit academic.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@azurIt_: What do you think? My problem with your pick is that the crawler does not attack. He only takes notes.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I know my pick is not the best one, it was closest category i was able to find.</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think both those could describe the actions of a crawler. Is looking to both an option?</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">s/looking/linking/ , sorry using phone this evening</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So if you think the best solution is to remove the capec from this rule, let's do it then.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think 2 categories is not good. It would be the only rule that does that and it would complicate the reporting a big deal.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@azurIt_, I'd like to keep this open for a few days. Maybe _@fzipitria_ has more to add. But good to know you agree we might want to rm this.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">2223: The regexp-assemble toolchain is getting better and better. Are we ready to merge this?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@maxleske_ / _@xanadu_ What is your current take on the status of  2223?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I think so. I'm already working on another improvement to support more use cases but I'd rather put that in a separate PR.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The documentation is easy to understand, I think anyone should be okay to move to using the new script</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Also this PR will un-block some issues waiting for the new system, which will be awesome</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Who else had a look at this? It's a major step, so I'm a bit nervous...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@franbuehler_?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(And there's a fix in there for one of the shell rules)</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(which I looked at with _@franbuehler_ and we added tests for it)</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Awesome</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Honestly, the risk is marginal. With the regexp-compare script  I can prove that the rules look the same as they did before.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And meanwhile they do look the same, don't they?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes. Except for the one we fixed :wink:</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">In confident in this one</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can have a look at this too if you want...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK. Thanks for the confirmation everyone.
_@xanadu_ Do you want to merge?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@franbuehler_ No, I think enough eyes are confident...</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sure</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">2222 Out Google OAuth2 detection is quite new - and not really working as _@azurIt_ found out. So he contributes a PR that improves the situation, yet he also thinks it should be a plugin anyways. Other OAuth2 users out there?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:08:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I see the complex problem here, yet I'm a bit uneasy about the plugin idea. It's an edge case for me (and depends on the complexity of the whole OAuth2 scheme that we might not really oversee so far) - and I would not mind somebody taking a very close look at this.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:09:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I do have a bit of OAuth2 experience, but I'm a bit tapped at the moment...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:11:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@azurIt_: Do you have OAuth2 installed?</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:11:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No :grin: Never used it.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:11:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think it's a topic we need to cover for the next major release.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:13:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@azurIt_: If we merge this, will the problem continue or do you think we're done? (outside of the plugin proposal)</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:16:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There are also other optional arguments in OAuth2 documentation, which are not covered by this PR - simply because i didn't want to blindly whitelisting args (especially because i really don't know OAuth2).</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:16:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Well done</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:16:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(test for rule 920410 is covered. This was a bit complex, because I had to extend the docker-compose file for CI)</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:17:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's fine, it is the idea.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:16:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@azurIt_: Could you open an issue we need to look at this carefully, maybe do it as plugin - and then we review this PR and merge it. That way we don't forget it and the PR gets off the queue.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello _@theMiddle_!</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">With this, I think we're done. The other PRs are not yet mergable. But it would pay if some volunteer would go through them and see if they can be unblocked, enhanced or fixed ...</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Either way, let's look at the projects we started last week, if you do not mind.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:23:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Are you OK with continuing this work? Perhaps sourcing from the rest of the team? I'd be happy to contribute as well, but some guidance as to where you need me would be welcome.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:23:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The technical blog posts were formally assigned to _@theMiddle_. But then he was more busy with the demo site. Is this something you want to drive in the coming months or should we find a new person responsible for this?</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Deal?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The demo site is almost presentable. _@fzipitria_ wants to take a closer look at the setup so we do not open up any vulnerabilities. Afterwards, we could release this - and then look at more features with a mid-term horizon.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I like the project board idea. Link?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:30:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Also because we said we want to try out the project board idea for CRS. So this is a test run.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:32:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'll take a look, thank you.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:32:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Let's move to the Status page.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:34:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Here we have almost cleared the first pre-condition. The next one is looking at go-ftw and its missing features. And in parallel getting the administration (-> Credit cards for Cloud Provider bills) sorted out. The problem I see here is that we have not found somebody who would like to steer this forward. Or at least, this is my impression.
I'd love to contribute and happy to coordinate with OWASP HQ, but I would prefer not to track this...</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:36:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Is there a chance that we would get credits from the cloud providers that we could use for this?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:37:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I mean, the do hand out 300 credits to anybody...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:37:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We might. But that takes more coordination...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:37:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I reckon we get credits the moment they start sponsoring us. Or after we found the right door to know on.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:37:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Not sure how far we get on 300 credits...</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:37:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">fair enough</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:37:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">how can we collect the ideas about this sub-project? Will we open a new issue?

Eg.: The next one is looking at go-ftw and its missing features - where can we add the ideas about go-ftw to?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:38:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">or should we add these ideas to go-ftw as feature request?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:39:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Where does the 'Test Runner' box live? Is that going to be in a cloud environment somewhere?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:39:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@xanadu_ Yes, another cloud thing.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:40:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@airween_: I guess we need a separate github repo like the sandbox. We could track it there, or in the wiki.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:40:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">thanks!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:41:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So let's continue with the next steps for the Status page and maybe we find a volunteer to also track this in detail.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:42:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can start with cloud providers</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:42:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The invoice problem or the setup?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:42:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Both</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:43:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You're my hero. Thank you. _@airween_ can you look at go-ftw and what we need there?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:43:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">sure!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:44:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you both.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:44:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That should keep us busy for several weeks.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:45:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And then there is of course Coraza. Lead dev Juan Pablo told me he would join us tonight. The blog post is very thin on details about Coraza, so here is more: Coraza seems very interesting and we like Juan Pablo a lot.
Good news: He now thinks Apache + NGINX connector modules are possible.
Missing: a C developer able to write them. But knowing it can be done solves a big problem.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:46:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_ and I will certainly keep in touch with him and keep you posted on Coraza.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:46:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">my note: C developer must to have strong skills to write Apache and Nginx modules....</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:47:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That would help, yes. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:48:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But that is also relatively well documented and there are countless Apache modules to learn from.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:51:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We're slowly coming to an end here: My idea with having people drive the projects we launched at the summit is to make sure they do not fall asleep. Ideally, this is a way to form small teams around these topics and these teams can then report their status once a month. I've done this in other organisations before and I think it might work here too. Also to distribute the load on more shoulders.

A result from the planning workshop was to from another little team to prepare the monthly chats. Happy to have support on this front, please DM.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:52:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">One other thing: _@dune73_ did you take a look at the precomposed issue answers I wrote?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:52:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No, I forgot about that. Sorry. Can you link them for me again. Putting it on my list.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:53:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anything else, or time to close the meeting?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:54:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">My idea with having people drive the projects we launched at the summit - can you summary (not now - later...) which projects are there? May be anyone can choose one or more...</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:55:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">or if the groups are done and working, then anyone can join to other team. May be a wiki page would be fine for this.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:57:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The projects are the ones we covered here in the chat - also the ones listed in the wiki. I'll update them with permanent leaders and feel free to contact / join. We're not really separated anyways. It's just that more topics now might get somebody to keep an eye on things. I do not really like this formalization, but if it works and does not ruin the project, then it could help us grow beyond 15 or 20 developers.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:58:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you _@maxleske_ I did look at these and now took note to expand them a bit. Just forgot about it.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:59:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe this is part of the onboarding process? An easy way for new people to see "Here are things you can get involved with", and then a list of open/ongoing projects and tasks people can join if they are interested.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:00:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, maybe. Or it's all a bit much. Let's see how this develops. But if we want to keep these "projects" alive we need to track them somehow. Or at least this is what I think.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:01:09 UTC</span>
