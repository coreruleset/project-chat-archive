**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:30:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I expect this to be blocked so I guess I’ll add a :wave: too</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">and don’t forget, if you need quick food, there is Take Eat Justaway</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No, Take Eat Justaway is not here anymore. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">but maybe if they give us a sponsorship :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Will develop 4 pizza</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi everyone</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I actually hooked on a call with JET last week so they could get to know the project. They are heavy users and will come back with ideas how they can support the project, even if not as a sponsor which I deem unlikely.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello everybody, welcome to the chat.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good news: It's the last chat of the year!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Always nice to hear when the project is used!</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good evening</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes! The next one is Jan 3rd. Not a problem for me, I have no travel plans, in fact I have no plans, because the Netherlands is back in lockdown.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello :wave:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We were quite,m quite lucky with our Switzerland planning..</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Need to have luck in life sometimes.</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hello everybody</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi _@emphazer_ :smoking:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(For those not in the loop: _@walter_ is like the luckiest person in IT because he runs an ISP with litterally NO EXPOSURE to log4j!)</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yep, no java anywhere!</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I had a real nightmare week...</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">at least that I know of……..</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That was the price you had to pay for your vegan holidays in Lanzarote, _@emphazer_!</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think so too</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yeah, it was intense. Apache httpd has a few vulns today too, but in niche features, so probably good. At least they are getting a lot of scrutiny from outside now.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi</span>

**jptosso** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi there</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey, hey, we're almost complete now.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you all for joining!</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi all!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Here is our agenda: [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2291](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2291)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Before we kick this off: dev-on-duty is not covered starting next week.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ah, I see _@azurIt_ took it over.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So we only need to fill January.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Who wants to do dev-on-duty week 1 to 4 2022?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:wave:</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can take one week</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would like a bit of time to catch up and am still overworked but I could try to fill week 4.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I’ll be off for the first two :confused:</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can also take one of them.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can take week 3.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@Paul Beckett_ you said you would be generall yinterested as well, but only after a period of adoption...</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">then I will take the first week</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">then maybe a pair-dev-on-duty is a good way to get comfortable</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good idea</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I've got a lot going on in January.... So would rather wait a bit longer if that's ok</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">absolutely fine</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No worries Paul, it seems we're covered for the month.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Please everybody fill it in.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Then 2 things about the project.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We prepared a statement about TW / ModSec to be released tomorrow. Actually Thu last week, but then log4j</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Now OWASP is intervening asking us to tune it down. A lot.
They fear retaliation on OWASP as a whole from TW and friends.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">wtf</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Does TW have friends?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yep. It will be the first time where we come out publicly about the ModSecurity 3 problems. But OWASP wants to have a more positive mood to the message and don’t burn bridges with Trustwave.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm unhappy about this development but there is little we can do if we do not want to ruin our relationship with HQ.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">TW might have friends as in "big corps do not like other big corps eating shit".</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@walter_ did we come out publicly?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So exec director wants to do a call with us tomorrow and I will think about rewriting our polished statement without mentioning TW.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@airween_ well, we’ve complained a lot on GitHub, but we haven’t made a full blog post for our users about the ModSec3 deviances and the performance issues.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Actually, it might even be possible to write it without naming TW.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And if it's obvious that a name is missing, then it's all the more clear why it is missing.</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">TW feature in my question to Atomicorp that they are planning to write a white paper response to</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yep. We want to give a small nod to Atomicorp to stay friendly with them and hopefully improve our collaboration.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anyways, we really wanted to have this out the door before Christmas, but it's no longer sure we can. That would mean January then - and like starting the year with a "nameless" boom.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good point: If you did not follow the conversation last week - mostly on the dev channel - Atomicorp did a webinar where they have been very positive about the bright future of ModSec very close to Atomicorp.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I wrote to them and asked for coordination, but no response so far.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I actually don’t mind a bit of waiting period, a lot of readers might still be busy on Log4j right now…</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Might be worth seeing what Atomicorp come out with and if there's a formal handover happening from TW</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:49:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But that's like the only positive about waiting even longer.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:49:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">the wait might be worth our improved  relationship with OWASP HQ and the post will probably end up better than one written by two frustrated CRS people.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe yes.

But anyways, 2nd item. Tomorrow, Swiss newspaper NZZ, a fairly important news outlet, will do an article about open source software in general and its relationship with commercial software.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This comes out of the log4j coverage.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Nice!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The article will feature several quotes from me about CRS and how we work with companies.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And it will also cover some shit a Swiss Company said about us in a marketing video last spring.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I intervened, but never got a response. Now the newspaper called them and the video disappeared from youtube. And the CEO wants to talk to me.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Apologies and everything.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The idea is to see if we can get into a partnership situation here. That would bring some good out of a really annoying situation. I saw some positive signals today, but I do not trust them - at least not until I have talked to the CEO.
My plan - which changed like 10 times today - is now to keep a low profile when the article comes out tomorrow. Just so you know. And if the CEO is not interested in a partnership, we can always grow.
I have a copy of the video btw.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But it is very cool to have our name metnioned in NZZ!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes! :partying_face:</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:tada:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Time to get going, but I see Walter typing ...</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I have a small proposal. Christian (not to mention a lot of others) spent probably a full work week on our response to Log4j. It was well done, it was quick and it probably required turning down paying clients. What do you think about allowing Chrstian a one-time “super-dev-on-duty” payout of 4 hours for coordinating our Log4j response? This should not be a precedent but I think in this case it is a fair compensation, otherwise we would not have made such a splash and we would not have been able to help so many people.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:58:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">As leaders we could just decide this, technically, but I’d like your opinions.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:58:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Great idea. I support that. However, I don't know who else helped and how much.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think this is a great idea and I agree with it!!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think I spent about 30 hours on CRS->log4j last week.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Having CRS cover a subset of this would be very welcome.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think a lot of work went into the sandbox too, some on a tight deadline, and I wouldn’t mind giving some thanks in form of a payment.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What I do not like is the precedent. And that it's me.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sure. We basically are entitled to the funds.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think also most of the folks around should realize that we are really that first line of defense</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And for this case, buying them that precious time while the dev teams go patch</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@airween_ you kept an eye on twitter. What was your impression?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Basically we saved a lot of people a ton of Money</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hopefully they can start financing the project now</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes we did. I got some ACKs, mostly from customers, but I know that several intergrators also used our new rule(s) and on top our assessment.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And I know we are all tired from this past week, but this is the moment of telling everyone why we are here.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">For many it was a public re-assurance of that they discussed internally. For others it was an experience.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">s/experience/inspiration/</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">well, I just kept my eyes because I had the duty :slightly_smiling_face:
As I wrote my impression was that there where even more tweet about ModSecurity in log4j context. The hashtags were ModSecurity in most cases, but I think everyone knew that the point here the rule set</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Will they (integrators) begin to sponsor the project?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And I would expect more publicity from OWASP because of this</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I get that everyone is patching nowadays</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But it is a serious talk for next year</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Don’t forget log4j</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, we should get this into the OWASP mailing.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Microsoft Azure wrote in on Sunday morning about our assessment. I gave it to them, asked to revive the sponsorship discussion, but never got a response.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I don't expect new sponsors over this, but you never know.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Always worth asking!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">2 new sponsors are in the making btw and 2 of the previous ones confirmed they are going to pay 2022.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Always worth asking: You do not want to know just how much I am pestering them. The problem, I'm pestering my contacts and that's the techies and they do not have a say in this. They can only forward.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:08:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But the Log4j situation was an excellent mass hysteria that will revitalize the discussion about keeping open source alive.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:08:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's very generic, but it thinks that whitespace is acceptable since log4j will choke on whitespace.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:45:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It would be ideal to have it in PL1 namely against log4j, but then it looks like attracting a lot of FPs, but then almost no reports about FPs. It's really hard.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:46:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">On top: 932130 is very strong, but know to throw FPs and not yet applied to Request Headers.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:46:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But when we suggested to do that with 932130, we got no reports about FPs. So I wonder if that would be acceptable moving forward.</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:47:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thinking about 2228, couldn't an attacker bypass this by just creating their own PTR record?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:47:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Does 932130 really throw so many FP? My memory is not fully clear but it looks fairly safe to me.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:47:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@theMiddle_ 2163 is dead since it looks it can not be done on MOdSec 2.9 and Coraza, but the rule file renaming will be done in a separate PR and the new rule will be covered in an issue to make sure we don't lose it.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:47:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sqreen reports a lot of FPs for the rule.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:48:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">They disabled it.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:48:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I lack the traffic to know for sure these days.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:48:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I am confident it would be save on almost all headers but maybe not cookies and not Referer depending on the applications.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:48:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sqreen doesn't have a full compatible engine with modsec and CRS...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:49:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I do not know enough about their setup why they might see more FPs than others, but it's true that they disable a lot of rules over FPs.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:49:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We should do two lookups. If an attacker sets his rDNS to [foo.google.com](http://foo.google.com), it will resolve to them. But then we are looking up [foo.google.com](http://foo.google.com) and it will fail.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:50:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's the way you should use it :) remove false positive and do exceptions</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:50:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Tell that to sqreen ... :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

↳ **theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:27:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">definitely not my problem :slightly_smiling_face: It’s a pity because we can’t have a valid solution for XXE either when the request is not application/xml. That’s a huge limit.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:50:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So you guys think we expand 932130.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:50:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">To all headers or only UA + Referer?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:51:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Really reluctant with cookies ...</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:51:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I’m not so scared. I’m willing to expand the targets to headers and try out the dev branch for a while.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:51:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@dune73_ You said above that 1005 produces many FP's. What kind? The rule looks fairly specific...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:52:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No, the regex looks like it might have FPs, but then no report whatsoever since I removed REQUEST_BODY from target list.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:52:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So I do not know.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:53:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Just semantically, I don't think this should be mixed with 932130.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:53:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That rule targets shells</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:53:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Agreed.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:53:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So where do we put 1005?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:53:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And do we put it on PL1?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:54:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">we have a JAVA file</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:54:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">REQUEST-944-APPLICATION-ATTACK-JAVA?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:54:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think it will give us little trouble oh PL1…</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:54:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The first part of the 1005 regex is "nested use of ${" and that is highly generic for me.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:54:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But the 2nd part is of course JAVA specific, that's true.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:55:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So, it's a question of branding? Do we want to brand it as "The Log4j rule" or not?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:55:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we should. We also did it with Shellshock.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:55:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:56:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And maybe move the cookie arg into a higher PL</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:56:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The problem with that natural approach is, that people who do not run JAVA will think the rule has no value and then they lose it.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:56:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We could also add the nested ${ to 932130...</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:56:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">will we do a mini-release with just this rule, or are we going to wait until the next big release? (4.0, some quite ambitious changes, takeup could take long)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:56:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm really undecided.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:57:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we should wait.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:57:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Plenty of people were happy to serve themselves.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:57:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;"> We could also add the nested ${ to 932130...That makes more sense to me. If the common thing you think is interesting is the nesting, then let's talk about that in a separate issue.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:57:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe we will offer a special channel for things like this in the future, but I do not yet see a clean way of doing so, and I would have to do 3.3.3 with a new experimental rule.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:58:32 UTC</span>
