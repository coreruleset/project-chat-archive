<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you _@walter_</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">CRS meeting time. Is anybody around today / tonight?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey _@xanadu_, good to see you.</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good <insert-local-time-of-day></span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hello Paul!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I have not received a reimbursement request from you guys for Varese. Could you please send me your receipts?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Will do.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi there</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello _@airween_.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Same for you: Please send receipts for travel reimbursement</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks, but I do not have any receipts: DW payed me airplane tickets, and Andrea came for me and took me back.</span>

↳ **dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Awesome. Many thanks to DigitalWave then!</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@airween_ Sorry for not replying to your message about DDoS things. I've been super busy.</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No prob :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This looks like a somewhat lonely meeting, but I guess the late agenda and the general exhaustion is taxing ...</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hello!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello _@theMiddle_!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Alessandro sent me the next developer portrait: It's the one about _@airween_. Nice text. Did not know you did radio ...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The next in the queue will then be _@franbuehler_. And no schedule for 2023 so far.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Did not know you did radio ... - but I said :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">btw thanks :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe you did, but now it's black on white (and my memory regularly fails me... sorry)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK, I have prepared our agenda at
[https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2824](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2824)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Walter, Felipe and I ran a separate leader meeting where we looked into things that we think need to be done before the CRS4 release, or RC2 to be more precise.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That list is in the agenda, if you scroll down.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Tasks are marked as MUST and CAN.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Can you see anything vital that we missed?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">"Document and phase 1 rules"</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What does this one mean?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Moving rules to phase 1?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I’m here now :wave:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sorry, it means that a lot of people run a lot of ModSecurity / CRS inside locations and with the shift of a lot of our rules that leads to problems. We absolutely need to document this behaviour change.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey _@fzipitria_, glad you came. We'd be somewhat lost without you.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ahh, yes. I follow now.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">rules at phase:1 are quite a problem for nginx integrators :confused:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Reviewing the preliminary CRS4 task list, now in the agenda.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What is the phase:1 problem for nginx?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey, hey, _@franbuehler_!</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">a deny at phase:1 occurs before nginx can take actions like replacing the response body of a 403</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If anybody sees an omission in this task list, please shout. We need to settle on the open tasks, so we can tackle them.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">or running other modules like the lua module</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You mean CRS functionality works, but integration and custom setups suffer?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">a bit, yes, nothing critical or blocking but yes</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(-> then we need to explain to people they should stick to phase 2 blocking and they should not activate early blocking or it could lead to problems depending on the setup)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@xanadu_ do you agree this could be part of a larger document describing early blocking and how the shift of rules into phase 1 affects existing setups?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I have a blog post in mind that appears before we push CRS4. Maybe between RC2 and CRS4.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes. We have content on early blocking, but we could certainly expand to talk about phase 1 and its caveats/problems.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The tricky part is anticipating all possible side effects based on what we can learn how people use this.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">On the plus side, I think most modern documentation refrains from <Location> rule writing, but it was definitely something Ivan Ristic recommended.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">and, what about the retreat idea about boosting performance removing unneeded variables from rules?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">is something MUST/CAN on RC2?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:49:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Personally I saw this as part of a larger performance campaign for 4.1. But we never really talked this through. If anybody does the work for CRS4, then I think we would profit.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">is doing it on a subset of ruleset file an option?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">if yes I can start working on it :smile:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Like doing a rule that removes unnecessary ARGS from 941?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Can't you do this as a plugin, we expand as we move along and mainline it for 4.1?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">like a performance plugin?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes. You could also remove unnecessary PL-skip rules in every rule file.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And rules in general: If running PL1, no need for anything PL2 and above.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">sounds like a great idea</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ooh. That would be very interesting to measure for performance.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If plugin we could experiment with various techniques. I am sure we can come up with very creative stuff
(-> save 1000 most frequent vanilla UAs into data file, if request's UA is one of those remove from all the rules)</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">it becomes a "critical" plugin, I mean: every changes on any rules on CRS will reflect on that plugin</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Automation for the win.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">but, it sounds really cool to have</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">do you think a test that automatically checks if something changes on CRS and some works needs to be done on plugin?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Think so too.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think such a check would be viable, yes.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But let's get back to the agenda: Is there anything else we are missing?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:58:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I do not hear anything, so I guess that's the basic list.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Easy stuff first: _@airween_ what is the status of your additional tests / linting. Is this ready to be merged? Has it been merged? Are there still open tasks on that front?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@franbuehler_ would you be so kind and write down our decisions tonight?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ok.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@franbuehler_ Shivam Bathla's bypasses are on good tracks in your hands, are not they? Or do you need support on that front?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, they are. He reviewed my fixes and found 6 new bypasses. He did a really good job in reviewing my PRs and now he wrote a very well written and structered email what I have to fix.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If I need help, I will ask...</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Status: I have to clean up the code.
None of them are merged, but one test is always failed, because there are some uninitialized TX variables. I mentioned few options under the issue.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you _@franbuehler_. Can you give an estimated time frame for fixing everything?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">2 weeks? Is that ok? Too late?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That is fine and non critical.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thought: I think we need to fix all bug bounty issues and this before RC2 or we get new / updated rules into the final release that could break. This is correct, is not it?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@airween_: So you need a decision, or somebody finishing the review and merging the stuff?</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:09:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Let me find the issue...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:09:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@maxleske_ and _@fzipitria_: The status of the bug bounty findings has not moved the last two weeks. Is this OK and the changes are coming now that the toolchain has been migrated / activated? Or do we need a renewed effort by the team to get down to business?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:12:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we need to balance this effort with the keyword list updates (20 open issues!). Or we go bug bounty first and list updates afterwards.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I agree the first two items should be removed. The anomaly_score is there for audit-console (some old software) compatibility and I think keeping that is not overly bad since it's core functionality.
If two plugins need something, there is nothing wrong with both plugins providing it and if that's too expensive then either one of them can make the generation of said variable optional via a config item and use the variable from the other plugin.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, that would be cool.

But this feature definitely checks that variable is used. So the next step is that we print that value in some msg text</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:40:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Come on, initializing is a viable compromise.
If you insist it's being written in a msg I am inclined to write a rule with a msg in 980 and add a rule that removes said rule.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK, since it's a yes, I htink we do not have the sum of inbound and outbound in 980170 and we could indeed display tx.anomaly_score as a combination of the two. That would satisfy _@airween_ and have some minimal value on top.
Proposal: We call it COMBINED_SCORE=%{tx.anomaly_score} near the end.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:09:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If we don't keep the lists updated, then we should remove them</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:09:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Is there some value in divide and rule?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:09:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">They only five users a false sense of security</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:10:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We prioritize the ones we really want for CRSv4 (the ones that lead to the biggest number of bypasses in the bug bounty) and we postpone the rest?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:10:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Lists are crucial for Lowe paranoia levels also</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:10:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ok, but we can't remove lists anyway :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:11:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I totally see this. I just do not see us completing this task without postponing CRSv4 indefinitely.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:11:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think Paul is right, that we could ask the pentesters what they would use.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:11:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">expecially lists related to specific languages functions like PHP, Java, etc..</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:11:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think it's reasonable to decide on a subset that we absolutely need for v4</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:12:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">or a subset that we are confident with or for which we have a well known source?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:12:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_ do we have an idea which bug bounty reports were caused by outdated lists?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:13:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If we have that, we can identify the lists in question and the reporter in question.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:13:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We count the entries for the individual list and deduce the priorities. Then we send an email to the bug bounty hunters (I have contact with all of them).</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:16:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Typically an attacker wants to make a system call. I think most languages only have a relatively small number of ways to do that. Maybe we could focus in on just that scenario?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:16:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That would demand even more inside knowledge of said languages. It would mean we need to know which commands can lead to a system call.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:17:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Any opinion on my approach to prioritizing?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:17:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I don't know</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:17:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It is not that difficult, it just takes time</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:17:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">idk because executing a PHP function is even critical and could lead to read/write on fs</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:18:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Doing some effort is better than nothing</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:18:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Adding to the pressure: The longer we postpone the release over the word list, the longer we keep other rules from our users (webshell detection anyone?)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:18:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we might underestimate the difficulty. How can we tell we found a correct and actively maintained list.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:18:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Not sure whether number of findings is the best metric. Impact of finding would make more sense to me.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:19:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If there is authority, then it's simple, but scanners-headers etc is super tough.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:19:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">languages has documentation, I think it's a well maintained list</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:20:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Again: Do we know which findings we are talking about?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:20:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">all lists related to user-agent it should be not-critical at all</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:20:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Even that list in front our eyes might clear things up a big deal.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:20:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">My proposal is: can we just look at the lists instead of talking about them?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:20:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I agree on the UAs.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:21:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I do not think we can not look at 17 lists tonight.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:21:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think most people don't have a clue on what a list is</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:21:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Not now.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:21:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But we can postpone to the December meeting and fix the bug bounty items by then.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:21:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That would free resources, I think.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:22:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And get everybody on board to finish that task together.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:22:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Please</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:22:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And people can take a look and start comments on the issues about specific lists</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:23:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK, so here is the plea: Please use the next two weeks to look at [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%3Azap%3A+list+update%22](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%3Azap%3A+list+update%22)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:24:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Think about the lists and how you would assemble / update them. If you think some are more important than others, then say so in the comments.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:25:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@xanadu_ OK with you?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:25:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sure :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:26:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Very well, unless there is something super pressing, I suggest we close the meeting for tonight.</span>
