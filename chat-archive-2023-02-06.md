<span style="font-size: 90%;">Welcome everyone to the chat.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello!</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Nice to see _@Matteo Pace_ also made it :wave:</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hello!</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi _@azurIt_</span>

**JC** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Aloha</span>

**Matteo Pace** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi everyone!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">helo!</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Can someone help out with the protocol?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi there, sorry I'm so exhausted.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Well, no matter. I can do it after the meeting</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey _@azurIt_ joins the meeting. Very nice to see you!</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The protocol?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yeah, just the decision log that _@franbuehler_ usually takes care of.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ahh, right</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can do that, if you want?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, please. Much obliged</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So, first item on the list: Dublin</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anything we need to discuss?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We're getting an AirBnB for our devs. 12 guests joining.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">please say hello to albinowax for me</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">1-2, sorry.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Probably this one [https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/43061299?adults=7&check_in=2023-02-12&check_out=2023-02-18&source_impression_id=p3_1675617982_MEKJnkO2VLsGlGbA](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/43061299?adults=7&check_in=2023-02-12&check_out=2023-02-18&source_impression_id=p3_1675617982_MEKJnkO2VLsGlGbA)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If anybody objects, please tell me soon. Will book tomorrow or so.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Other than that, unfortunately very small crowd showing up. Like 10 people or so. Will need to think about program since we'll have a hard time to fill the day that way.
On the plus side: Everything will be recorded.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Other than that, nothing to talk about Dublin as far as I can see.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The first one, small to get the ball rolling for a massive one next year? :smile: :chart_with_upwards_trend::arrow_up:</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">*first one since the pandemic</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Next topic: Bug bounty</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I want to give an update quickly.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi there, I'm going to join soon - sorry</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The refactoring that _@fzipitria_ and I did has really paid off. With that PR (which hasn't been merged yet) I was able to mark most of the remaining BB issues as fixed.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That is awesome!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I thought it was a long bet, but I'm relieved it worked - as promised.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Some of the issues we'll have to quickly look at because they would currently not be fixed as they fall into the "FP prone" category. I'll let you know when I need you for this.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can help with the review during the week. Also as promised.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks!</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">me too, also for the FPs thing</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There's currently one more open issue that I will fix today (or tomorrow, since I'm moderating today).</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Which PRs are we talking about currently, (just to have it in the log of the chat).</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The only remaining ones are then those assigned to _@theMiddle_</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm trying to run the latest current branch on produciton</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">to see how it goes with FPs</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The refactoring PR (unmerged) is [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/pull/3092](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/pull/3092)</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Then there's a draft PR for fixing one of the issues: [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/pull/3120](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/pull/3120)</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">have I assigned PR?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And of course, there's still an open PR from _@franbuehler_ who has taken care of all the new PL 2 rules for Referer and User-Agent header checks.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:33 UTC</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Of note: I've been using the new include-except processor in the toolchain to do the refactoring. I think it was a good decision to go this way, even though it's certainly not perfect.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If there are no questions, let's move to the next topic.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think this construct is useful and pragmatic.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@maxleske_ you did a testrun on all the open BB findings and got almost all of them fixed? I did not have the time to run the scripts in the bug bounty test repo against the PRs.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:49:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I haven't run your script, no. I've been running the curl commands individually.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It says it's adding headers to PL2 rule but the rule is in PL1.</span>

↳ **maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You're right. Could you add that comment to the PR directly please?</span>

↳ **azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Done.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I didn't see a value in running the script yet either, since there's still some stuff to be merged</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No worries. If the curl get the expected results, then we're covered. I'll run the script and report the stats.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So, developer portrait: [https://coreruleset.org/20230117/meet-the-crs-team-franzi-the-puzzle-loving-hard-worker-with-a-mission/](https://coreruleset.org/20230117/meet-the-crs-team-franzi-the-puzzle-loving-hard-worker-with-a-mission/)</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Again, a fun read. Did not know that _@franbuehler_ is into martial arts :sweat_smile:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Same :smile:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's been the third one so far. (With _@theMiddle_ and _@airween_) in earlier editions. Ultimately something our sponsors pay and it's a way for us to return something to the developers (that is something you can not easily buy with your own money, or you are unlikely to do so.)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The idea is to continue this throughout the year. Like 4-6 in 2023.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Alessandro has not decided which one is next, but open for suggestions.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The idea is also to interest potential developers for our project. And to make it more tangible from the outside.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What do you all think about it?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good plan, or do we need somehting else?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I love it and I think we should definitely continue!</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think it's great! Even for us. We don't meet often enough to know all those things about each other</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@JC_ and _@Matteo Pace_ you are not developers. What do you think?</span>

↳ **Matteo Pace** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I really enjoy them, it makes the project what more "human" than a repo with cool rules</span>

↳ **JC** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think it is good to involve devs as in the end it brings another perspective. Also leverages collaboration and great discussions like the one we had around evaluating phase 1 as soon as ARGS_GET are in place.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's nice to show the project devs as a.) real human beings and b.) fun people to work with! And not just nicknames on a screen. It's a great idea for attracting new developers to get involved.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Did they come to us or did you "actively pursue" them _@dune73_?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Every sponsor is different. In the case of Edgio, I was in touch with the team for like 5 years. The company changed hands 3 times during the period.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If you have read the financial accounts of CRS, I implied that one sponsor did not pay for 2022. In fact they did pay on Dec 22 and HQ failed to inform us.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There is another announcement in the queue and there are 2-3 additional potential sponsors. But I am not as pushy as I was in early 2022 anymore.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Other ones really got in touch with us. Google for example.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The sponsoring newsletter has been sent out as well and is accessible on the Google Drive.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Usually it's been a longterm sales job over the course of 1-2 years.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Nothing more to add. Feel free to DM if you want to know more details.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">With the BB out of the way, we can shift the focus on the keyword lists and the less complex stuff and then we're done.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes. I'll put my energy into the lists.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think those were the most important items from the development front</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would love to see 3.3.5, and have been waiting for it. But if we do "here is how you roll your own 3.3.5" then I could be okay with that.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That could be a plan.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:08:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe even a patch file for integrators and users to download and apply.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:08:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If we want to avoid a full release.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:08:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The question is how  would have the capacity to do this? It would be kind of a blog post + patch, would not it?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:09:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I could handle that part, if we decide not to do a release. I will need to patch CRS on my company's appliance anyway, so…</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:09:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And I guess other integrators will also be sticking on 3.x and not jumping to 4.0 for a while, too.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:10:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So they would probably need a fix of some sort.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:11:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If these new bugs aren't a big deal then we could wait until we release 4.0 and release 3.3.5 more or less in parallel, so that everybody gets something. That would also give us the opportunity to backport more stuff, if necessary.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:12:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That could be an interesting option. Opinions?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:12:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Amazing, if we have the resources to do that (two releases).</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:13:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It is just a tiny bug, still I would be in favor of fixing it, personally the problem is I am still very ill and doing a release might be hard for me right now (I already have energy shortage to meet deadlines at work and having to sell my sick mother’s old house)</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:14:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It probably will improve in 2 months but not earlier :( </span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:14:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">In an ideal world, we would have release automation in place for 4.0, but I doubt that we'll get there in time.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:14:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I suggest we do the blog post and if it works, we can always to the release ore or less together with 4.0.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:16:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ok. So _@xanadu_, _@dune73_ can you work together to do blog post + patch in that case?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Someone added an idea:

Website idea: Should we add a prominent "Get Involved" section to the front page of [coreruleset.org](http://coreruleset.org)? Something like:
"We're always looking for keen problem solvers to join our team… Get in touch / talk to us / join a meeting / click here for more info, etc."?</span>

↳ **JC** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:19:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sounds interesting. Will this be personalised or like a general link in slack? My hunch is that this always ends up in dead end. If instead we had someone to onboard this people would be great.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sorry, that was another one of my ideas :sweat_smile:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I like it!</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:19:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">With all the great dev portrat stuff, I thought it would be good to have a big and obvious "get involved! CRS is great fun!" section/button somewhere on the homepage</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:19:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But not urgent…</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:19:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That would help on the website.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:20:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We should also re-organize the menues. Too many top level entries now. A litle brainstorming session with _@xanadu_, me, Alessandro and other interested parties might be fruitful.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:20:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Agreed, it’s already a bit too full.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:21:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(But GitHub could be changed to Get Involved, as a minimal option)</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:21:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Who's going to keep track of the idea? Do we open an issue on GH?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:22:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Issue!</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@JC_ If people get in touch, we shepherd them through the first PRs, usually they get to us via a PR or two and then I get in touch and invite them to join the meeting.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:24:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And with that we're done, I believe. Does anybody have anything else to share?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:25:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I had a late addition to the agenda. Something I realized I need to share with the project.

There is a rather fierce discussion you need to know about.

In Varese, I found out, that a BB report in fact leads to a rather exotic buffer over-read in ModSec 2.9.x.
_@airween_ reported this to ModSec with a PR, they issued a fix, did release 2.9.7 minimal changelog, no CVE, we let it flow.

Then suddenly Debian security jumps into action and issues a CVE based on the minimal changelog.

I got in touch with that team and explain the deeper problem. They update the CVE and now ModSec dev is very, very pissed with me. The private emails are getting quite explicit (without really calling me names).

Anyways, if we're lucky it's only me using the term "overflow" for "over-read" not realizing it's technically only used for writes, not for reads. That can be fixed. If we are unlucky, he thinks it's not an over-read and then we need to do a reality check which might be painful.

It's unfortunate, we did not see this coming. A problem that played into it that I was waiting for a comment from ModSec dev, but he was on holiday. So when he did not respond, I wrote to Debian... Once he returns from holiday, he goes balistic.

Anyways, I'll keep you posted.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I thought the relationship really improved in 2023, we made it clear we were really thankful for the professional handling of their share of BB reports. But now we're back in the trenches. :disappointed:</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:28:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This is so stupid. As if you would do such a thing on purpose.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:28:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I think we should make a friendly step towards the dev.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:28:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think so too…</span>

**JC** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:29:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">my 2p: E-mails, messaging or discussions over github usually loose tones and intention. I think a friendly call face2face would help to relieve the friction.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:29:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We're currently waiting for a response on a message from Airween where he explains the technical problem - the over-read - again.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:30:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Will the CVE and its score then be corrected?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:30:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Send them Läderach. (Only half joking.)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:31:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's currently saying "overflow" (did not check today). Debian is open to reword as they have done before.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:32:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think that was a series of unfortunate events. I'm sure no one had bad intentions, but despite of this, it happened what happened. I don't want to blame anyone (even though I've made mistakes too), but it's a really dumb situation.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:32:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Not ruling out a call to sort things out, but prior experience has been mixed at best.</span>
