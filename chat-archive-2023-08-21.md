**Edgars** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh, yes, it's been a while! It's one of my free evenings and I decided to take a part in the monthly chat.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello _@Dexter Chang_. Nice to see you.
Rest of the crowd: Dexter is our GSoC student and he is almost, almost done with the project.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:38:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I suggest we start with the issues on the agenda.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@xanadu_ and _@Matteo Pace_: What do we need to discuss here?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:39:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">For awareness: the agenda was empty, so I simply took the unresolved issues from the past 2 or 3 meetings and added them in :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This was one of them from, I think, 3 meetings ago.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Got you. I thought we had solved this more or less.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm unsure if this is a "it needs more time" or "it needs something else" issue.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Also: This is how we did meetings in the past: Review why issues we had discussed earlier where still not solved and what we could do. Then the issues got too numerous and we reorganized the project.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@Matteo Pace_ Did you have time to do the additional tests? It would be good to come to a resolution here.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">He's in the car so will probably not be able to respond immediately</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Correct. So let's continue and see if we can return to it afterwards.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:58 UTC</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This one might be fixed once I merge the PR I'm currently working on. Let's wait for that.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No problem. I am sorry this PR is blocked by me. Is there anybody able to take over the review and shepherding it into merging?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:09 UTC</span>

**Matteo Pace** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think it requires some care if we want to extract some more php functions (see my [latest comment](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/pull/3273#issuecomment-1675490075)) and double check if at least PL1 wordlists seems reasonable. Besides that, it is pretty stable</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:54:38 UTC</span>

**Matteo Pace** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The PR grew more than the expected, it includes the extended spell.sh and fixed/changed some tests that were duplicates</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You moved all the tests, did not you?Yes, I did. Only one test is currently commented (the original one was passing, but I changed it because it was a duplicate and I based the new one on the test description (match dl)) See [here](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/pull/3273/files#diff-bdd9aa9724be3307829cdf084e0b9ff0c733c40d32f9ff08a7ebb87a686b6bbbR56-R72).</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK. So we have _@theMiddle_ taking this over from me. Thank you for your work _@Matteo Pace_.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Here's a briefing for the GSoC project: the framework aims to detect any performance impact when any rule change (or multiple changes) is applied.

Currently, the framework works to capture matrices for rule changes with 2-line commands (e.g., CPU/memory/load test like p50,p75,p99/runtime/etc.) and it can integrate into GitHub Actions. example here: [https://github.com/coreruleset/rules-performance-tests#interactive-mode](https://github.com/coreruleset/rules-performance-tests#interactive-mode)

Though a few fixes/features are on the to-do list, it's almost ready to go. And I will still continue working on it and CRS-related projects after GSoC :)</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The PR that moves the GSoC report into the coreruleset github organization was merged today.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We talked about CRS v4.1 being a performance optimization release. Chances are, Dexter's framework gives us the necessary toolset to implement this for real. And given it's modular nature we should be able to accomodate for multiple engines.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This is really a very successful project.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That sounds awesome!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:18:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Indeed.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The project will be done during the week and mid-term evaluation was excellent.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anybody has any question for Dexter?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:20:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Was it hard to get into the project? Any documentation / help you would have wished for?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:20:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good question!</span>

**Dexter Chang** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:23:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">CRS is quite big (the scale and so many things to learn) for me initially. Especially it takes time for me to know many terms. I think an issue for me is that some documentation is outdated so I need to check on SpiderLab sometimes</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:23:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I see. Could you open issues for the things you consider outdated or missing from our project?</span>

**Dexter Chang** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:24:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sure np, I will check on my notes :+1:</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I get the feeling we are coming to an end of this meeting. Is there anyting we missed?</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good evening everyone! I have a very interesting question, mostly related to Nginx and Modsec. Nginx has a special response code - 444, that closes the connection. If I change the standard Modsec error code from 403 to 444, will nginx "drop" the connection to the client like action "drop"? By default in ModSec v3 "drop" and "deny" actions work the same way. Code 444 could probably help with this issue...</span>

↳ **brbrmaker** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:38:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">P.S. I tried it on my stand, for me this thing really works. If you set the response code to 444, then the nginx magic works and the request is returned to the client without additional headers ("Failed to load resource")</span>
