**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello everybody! Please raise your hands if you hate the new Slack design as much as I do.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh, I didn't realize</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:wave:</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">it's very weird. I wanted to switch back, but... no way to switch back :disappointed:</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It is… not good.</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good evening</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I came to the same conclusion.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I don't understand... to me it's almost identical...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey Paul, long time no see! How is Amber?</span>

**Matteo Pace** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No, it looks like a purple version of Teams now.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh, then just switch themes?</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Amber is well, thanks</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And I lost some 100 pixels with the new sidebar on the left.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That looks quite different to the old one. At least it looks different to the old Linux client.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">They've changed many visual cues, which makes it very disorienting.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I've always used a different theme</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">k</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">How do I switch themes (asking for a friend who is too lazy to google)?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">click your profile picture, choose preferences and then themes</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:39:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ah, there is a profile picture. Need to check this out after the meeting ... :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anyways, let's get on with our meeting.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We merged a huge PR by _@maxleske_ today.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Max: Was that the last keyword automation PR?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What is the issue number with the overview again?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I believe so.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:03 UTC</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Looks pretty sweet.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Now we've merged it, there are a couple of open issues that need to be reevaluated. I'll try to do that this week</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Very good.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think the road is clear now. There are minor things to do and ideas here and there (see agenda tonight) , but we're over the hill.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What do you think about a feature freeze at the end of the month and we try to do RC2 in Mid-October?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Full release before the retreat is probably too aggressive. But maybe November.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think a couple of weeks for freezing and stabilizing would be good. Also in order to get release management in place again. _@walter_ traditionally did this, but we are in the comfortable position that _@xanadu_ and _@fzipitria_ (correct me if I'm wrong) executed the last point release. So it basically looks good.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Do we have a label to mark stuff that should go into the release? Let's apply that one to open PRs and if need be issues.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If you need reviews for your stuff, please ping me and I can try and get that organized.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sep 30 is a Saturday. Is that OK for a feature freeze?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There's no label yet. I can crate one</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'll call it "v4"</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Please do.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No opposition to the feature freeze at the end of the month, so let's take that as decision then and we work with a v4 label.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We have additional 4 items on the agenda and I have 1-2 things to share afterwards.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The agenda is at: [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3279](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3279)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">First item is this issue here: [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3304](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3304)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The 3rd party dev of the roundcube plugin things we should solve this FP in our rule set directly. It's a response rule that triggers in a roundcube context. It's solved there, but he thinks it might cause problems elsewhere.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think he has a point. What do you think?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Today I learned that we have a PL2-specific PHP errors file for phrases that give high FPs.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Perhaps that would be a good place for this FP-causing phrase to live?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:54:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Which one is that?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:54:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The file is rules/php-errors-pl2.data</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:54:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The phrase causing the issue appears to be "File size is" which seems fairly common</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Very lonely entries. I second your proposal.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Just to note that point release is not a major release</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And this is a MAJOR release</span>

↳ **maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:56:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But it would be good to do at the retreat so we can coordinate and write automation as we go.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I agree, that looks like the place to put it</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:56:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I suggest we ask reporter to provide PR. OK?</span>

↳ **Matteo Pace** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I went for it. If we quickly want to move on on this one check [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/pull/3314](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/pull/3314)</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can quickly do that</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:58:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That brings us to [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2373](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2373) and the return of the problem of plugin intialization.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@azurIt_ is my memory for anything plugins and I do not remember the previous discussion anymore. Only that we have sort of solution until we redo the recommended rules for v4.1.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@maxleske_ what is the problem exactly with the DoS stuff? Why can't initcol run the moment it's supposed to run?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Found the January decision: [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3037#issuecomment-1384488207](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3037#issuecomment-1384488207)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">-> Decisions: CRS initializes them for the plugins, off by default</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">As _@xanadu_ has pointed out to me, the current solution, where the initialization is configured through the setup config file, was our solution for plugins. Unfortunately, that doesn't work (at least not for the current architecture of the DoS plugins) because the rules in the *-config.conf and *-before.confg files are read before 901-INITIALIZATION.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Got you. And DoS rules apparently need to run in phase 1.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's possible, that I could move all the rules to the *-after.conf file. However, this dependency would pretty  much defeat the purpose of having multiple configuration files</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Some of the rules, yes</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:05:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">With DoS you want to run and to block as early as possible. I think *-after would be stupid.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Do we have a chance to check for initcol and run it in the DoS plugin config? If we do that, then DoS plugin should remove the 901 rule in question dynamically.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe that's the solution anyways. Just remove the 901 rule via ctl statement and do initcol yourself.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:07:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can try to do that. If anyone knows by heart how to check collections for initialization, I'd be glad for some help.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:09:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@xanadu_ could you briefly summarize the problem?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:11:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sure. So, during the bug bounty we added jsDecode to rule 934100 to catch an evasion/obfuscation technique. A few months ago, a CRS user pointed out that it is still possible to evade the rule by putting the obfuscation before Base64 encoding a payload. So we fixed it by doing two rounds of anti-evasion transformations: one set before decoding, then another set after decoding. Now that rule catches both types of evasion.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:12:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We only fixed 1 rule, but there are several JavaScript rules that may be vulnerable to the same obfuscation technique. So, we need to fix all the rules.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:12:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I believe there are 5, and 1 is already fixed.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:12:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Cool.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:12:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think I can sort it, but might need a JS person to help.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:12:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I don't really know the JS side.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:12:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ping me. I worked on that original issue too.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:13:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So in 934100 we do t:urlDecodeUni,t:jsDecode,t:removeWhitespace,t:base64Decode,t:urlDecodeUni,t:jsDecode,t:removeWhitespace, and we would need to repeat this. Correct?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:13:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You're a star, thank you!</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:13:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we would repeat the same technique, yes. With slight variations depending on the original transformation pipeline for each rule.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:14:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">E.g. the whitespace thing was specific to the regex of a certain rule.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:14:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Do we expect a performance impact? I do not remember the discussion, but the huge pipeline looks familiar ...</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:14:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I was also wondering that. It's a multiMatch rule, so maybe.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:14:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can certainly run some numbers.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:15:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">With the jsDecode transformation, should we use that on all JavaScript-related rules? Is the \u0022 style evasion common to all JavaScript or just Node.js?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:16:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">New performance testing framework was built for the purpose. There is a draft blog post sitting in our wordpress that coul dbe used as a guide if you want to try.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:17:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's probably relevant to most JS rules, yes</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:17:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good to know. Thanks.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:17:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we should close the original PR here, as I think it's already covered in a PR we merged in April btw.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:17:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm happy to triple check and sort that out.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:17:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sounds very good.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:19:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Cool. So how is the dependency check situation _@maxleske_?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:19:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">For the record: We merged a new technique that allows to construct dependencies from issues and PRs with some GH magic. But then we ran intro troubles during the day?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:19:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There's an open PR to fix one last thing.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:20:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I just wanted to quickly let everyone know about the new functionality</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:22:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Please go ahead.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">In PRs you can now create dependencies. A dependency means that an additional merge check will prevent merges until the dependency has been resolved. To declare a dependency you have to mention it in the PR description (aka the first comment). For example depends on #4. The link can point to either a PR or an issue, so PRs can be dependent on issues.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:22:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This also works when the dependency is added later by editing the PR description.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:22:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's it. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:22:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Very cool.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:24:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Can't believe this isn't a feature in vanilla GitHub already!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:24:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It probably will be sooner or later.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:24:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Makes sense. Thanks _@maxleske_.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:24:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yeah, there's a whole discussion around that :slightly_smiling_face: But then, there are so many feature requests, they can't implement everything...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:25:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:25:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:25:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So 2 additional things.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:26:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OWASP published the candidates for the board elections in October. 4 seats if I'm not mistaken and 10 candidates.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:27:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There was a discussion that they should position themselves with regards to the controversies earlier this year incl. ZAP moving away from OWASP.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:27:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">They might do that in their personal statements via the platform. Check out for that if you are interested.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:28:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And if you are an OWASP member, please execute your right to vote. Vote count is usually very low, so every vote cast has a lot of weight.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:29:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Other topic: We have 2 drafts for the release poster.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:29:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I am not happy with the design yet, but we'll get there.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:29:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We'll share with devs once it's a reasonable quality.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:30:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ah, just found the message with the list of OWASP candidates:
The candidates for the OWASP 2023 Global Board of Directors are:
* Andrew Stevens
* Avi Douglen
* Bhaskara Ram Allam
* Fred Donovan
* Izar Tarandach
* Jeremy Long
* Kevin Johnson
* Mark Babcock
* Paulino Calderon
* Sam Stepanyan
* Steve Springett</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I know Sam Stepanyan personally. He's a London WAF engineer specializing in commercial WAFs, but he has a heart for CRS. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Steve is leading the project committee which I think he has built up nicely.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And Avi is an existing board member with a good track record. Even if I do not necessarily agree with everything he says, he is definitely dedicated to OWASP.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can not really say anything about the other candidates other than please vote!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Alessandro has just submitted his 2nd attempt at a renaming CRS concept. I have not looked at it (came in during the meeting), but he says he needs to do a workshop with us.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So this will probably take time...</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Will he join us in Budapest?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Not sure yet. He promised to discuss with his boss. He proposes to do a workshop in Budapest, but it's too late.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Any other questions, or anything we need to discuss?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">we have approximately two weeks to finalise number of participants in Budapest retreat</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That sounds doable. But thanks for the heads up.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">5th of October is the last date when we can modify the number. After that we lost some money if we decrease the amount, but we can increase it later</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Got you.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If there is nothing else, then let's call it a night!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you all for attending.</span>
