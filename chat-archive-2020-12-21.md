<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello, hello! Time for our monthly issue chat. Who is around to talk business here?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hey all!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">All is the new word for the two of us. :wink:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Franziska seems to be sick, but I have not heard from anybody else.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Azurit and Walter were active during the day...</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi!</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, I saw _@azurIt_ activity</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi there. Good to see you. Feeling better?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, thank you. I took some medicine...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Glad it helps.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Me too :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Today was a good day. My work for online voting this year was presented to the public and it looks awesome!</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Congratulations!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:01 UTC</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The report (only in German so far) is really impressive. And Open Source is pushed very much. Almost mandatory, but not quite.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Plus there is going to be a scientific committee accompanying the whole security discussions. I hope they pick me (again) as the moderator of said process.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Cool! I'll keep my fingers crossed for you!!</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'd really like to share this documentation with Hungarian Government - but I'm afraid they doesn't understand the points...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Take the following link (It's the English report from the dialog with the scientists), lots of takeaways for govs beyond Switzerland.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">In case the Orban government listens to anybody at all.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@franbuehler_ You will be pleased to hear that I took up work on said pcre performance blog post again.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">With _@airween_'s script it's good fun.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Great!!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@airween_: Can you do the performance summary? The Median would be really, really useful, but it's also a bit cumbersome / heavy to implement.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">sure, in next days/two weeks I'll have some free time, so I can focus for this project!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Wonderful. Thanks. I'll share the draft with you.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'll hopefully also learn about airweens script which I really should know it seems!!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Preliminary tests for PR 1868 look like there is no negative performance impact.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:49:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Performance with CPU cycles is always very odd. You think you can make a prediction, but you never really know until you have run the script.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:49:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh great! So this PR could finally be merged soon...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:49:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's also a question of coverage. The contributor has done a great many tests, but we might miss some attacks. But it's probably worth it.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I do not really know how to test for coverage really well.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Beyond his new unit tests.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So we might merge this, yes.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">For the record: I do not think an issue talk with 3 people is worthwhile. It will boil down to us who attend doing all the work and that's no fun.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I plan to contact people 1:1 and try to assign issues that way.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I see it's difficult to test for coverage if we don't have the tests. And from what I can see I can't really tell if the coverage is good enough... (it's been a while since I had a look at this rule...)</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, may be that would be more effective</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ok, yes, makes sense...</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">but I think the December (before 3 days of Christmas) is very special time...</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can take new issues or PRs.
I have more time now since my cert exam is over.
And I don't have open PRs or issues...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's not like this is the first time it's only 2-3 people in the issue chat.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We wanted to talk about this issue meeting in November.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Did you just volunteer for more work?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I did!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe we should address this in January again.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It seems that it doesn't work.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, it's not really a success. But I am confident it will change with the money flowing into the project as we speak.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And I don't exclude myself because I did not attend the first times, because I had no entry in my agenda...</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, maybe.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The invoice over 15K USD to our first sponsor has been sent. They intend to pay before the end of the year.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yay!! Oh wow!
That's huge!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:58:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I hope with the 1st sponsor, we become more attractive for additional ones. So I will intensify my work in this regard once the announcement is out. Probably a press release in January.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes! The to find the first sponsor is maybe the biggest work...</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, we should talk about it. Good idea.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I had a quick look at the issues. I could take: [#1950](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/1950), [#1931](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/1931), [#1914](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/1914)?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Does that make sense? Or do you want to distribute the work?</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey Azurit! Good to see you around.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Baby in bed, or is this the quiet time before it's time?</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">sorry for beeing late, i thought it starts at 21:00.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No worries.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We actually said it's no fun to do an issue chat with 3 people, but with 4 the game changes a bit and _@franbuehler_ volunteered for 3 items on the agenda.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">wow</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">respect!</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ok this seems to be good then? I'll self assign them.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">From afar they look a bit like easier picks, though. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:smile:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Honestly, I think 1942 would be important as would be 1922. So if we can get volunteers for those as well, we're already a big step towards Christmas for the project. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I took the first three and I don't like encoding things!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:smile:</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">so I skipped this Russian issue.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ROFL now.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">One moment, I'll ckeck...</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh no! That's the Russian one...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I wish I would meet somebody who enjoys encoding stuff from a blue team perspective.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What's a big beal about the Russion one?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I do not want to speak for anyone, but as I know, _@walter_ learns Russian...</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:smile:</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Haha, so he has to take it :wink:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">He's young and he's innocent. Let's try and talk azurit into 1942...</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No, I can take it too.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It doesn't matter.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I like SQLi issues and I do not like encoding issues. But it doesn't matter :joy:</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@franbuehler_ let me know, if you need any help - my colleague is perfect in Russian</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Come on, 4 is too much. Christmas is coming up after all. But if you want to trade one of the other ones, I'd be delighted bc I think you could master 1942.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ok. So I take 1942 and... one mment....</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:08:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">1931 and 1914?</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:08:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:open_mouth:</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:08:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I self assigned 1942</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:08:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@azurIt_: Encoding support in ModSec is not really well supported. ModSec is very much byte oriented and with Unicode / UTF8 it becomes really hairy. I am sure we have a ton of FPs for all sort of non-western languages. And we all expect this to be a rabbit hole where you start with Russian and not long and you are debugging Chinese SQL statements.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:09:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You're my hero!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:09:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I mean what else would we expect from a CISSP. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:09:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:heart_eyes:</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:09:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Haha!!</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:10:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Well, I'm not going to push myself in :smile:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:10:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Well done. But 1950 is free again. And that should be doable.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:10:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If you are able to reproduce the rule alert with the payload provided.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:11:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But i will help _@franbuehler_ with Russion one if it's needed.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:11:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The reporter only mentioned the blocking rule 949110. If you can not reproduce you need to ask for more infos or close.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:11:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Cool.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:11:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Any takers for the OAuth2 in 1922? That could be quite widespread.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:12:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I was interested in it but i didn't know what exactl to do with it.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:12:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I did not read it indetail. Give me a minute.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:12:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Should we, somehow, whitelist google URL staff?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:14:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm afraid we can't do to many things here... as I know, the ".profile" is a part of the built regex</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:14:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I think that's the right approach here. It's a google API used by many people and the guy got already 3 upvotes for the report along.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:14:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@airween_: We can do a chained rule that makes sure the profile is not part of the Google API call.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:15:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hmmm... not, it's not a compiled regex</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:15:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">An exclusion package maybe?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:15:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">chained rule is a better way IMHO</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:16:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ok</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:16:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I agree. I would not do an exclusion package for a single FP.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:17:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Welcome @walter. In the beginning it was only _@airween_ and me and now we're already 5. And most issues distributed.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:17:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@walter_ that couch again? :wink:</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">must be very comfortable</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">no worries _@walter_, we found a good issue which helps to improve your Russian language skills :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi all! sorry can't attend the meeting, but I'm slowly reading the chat. sorry about that (happy holidays to all)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:19:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Actually, I talked _@franbuehler_ into 1942, but if you feel you would deserve it as you are learning Russian...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:19:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey _@theMiddle_! Nice of you to say  hello!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:20:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">oh no, the Russian FPs again?</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:20:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:smile:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:20:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we had that one hashed out mostly in an earlier PRâ€¦</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:21:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Actually _@azurIt_ was ready to go full suicidal, but then _@franbuehler_ came to save him.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:21:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">but I donâ€™t think we did took any action</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:22:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I will discover this during my studies of this issue 1942
Or you're saying now that we don't fix this because we already had a look at this one.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:22:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we ultimately shied away to dig down to the bottom of things.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:23:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Iâ€™m trying to find the old issue, but I can only find [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/220](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/220)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:23:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But we can not really push this away endlessly.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:23:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think I remember it boiled down, on a high debug level, to things being ultimately seen by the engine as â€˜2>3â€™ or something and triggering a lot of rules</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:24:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh there are two russian issues!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:24:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ah, yes, I remember now. That was really odd.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:24:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">1942 and 1943</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:24:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I did not add 1943 to the mix for tonight.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:25:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">good</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:25:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">i think 1942 and 1943 are the same</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:26:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe yes. Maybe not. Let's have _@franbuehler_ cover 1942 and then we'll see.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:26:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@airween_ could you take on 1950?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">checking...</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can take it</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">thank you!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">great awesoem</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you _@airween_.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:28:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@azurIt_ asked to talk about 1912 here. Could you all take a quick look please?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:29:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:29:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">this looks like we could improve it by replacing the .* with a less broad pattern, if we know the strings we are looking for we could do .{1-10} for instance</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:30:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I have 0 Sybase experience. Do you think we can get a value zoo somewhere?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:30:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sybase was acquired byÂ [SAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP_AG)Â in 2010; SAP ceased using the Sybase name in 2014</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:31:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">seems itâ€™s legacy software nowâ€¦</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:31:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">i'm not running any sybase, unfortunately :disappointed:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:31:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hmm, it still seems around: [https://www.sap.com/acquired-brands/what-is-sybase.html](https://www.sap.com/acquired-brands/what-is-sybase.html) but itâ€™s commercial so not easy to spin up</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:32:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's the problem, but I am sure it will be in use for several years down the road</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:32:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And the rule is somehow botched. I mean that redundant chained construct ...</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:33:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">oh I thought that was rather clever (though hard to develop against)</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:33:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe we better drop Sybase support?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:34:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">maybe we could ask the person who apparently has sybase PHP extension loaded, to trigger an error?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:34:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hmm, ilt seems PHP deprecated sybase support also, as their duckduckgo hits are going to a 404 â€¦</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:35:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ah, you are a rules connaisseur...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:36:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Is not this a general pattern with the response rules that they look for a list of broad patterns and then a chain that is a bit more specific, but also somehwat redundant?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:36:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, they do a quick @pm for all the words that possibly could be there in any of the error messages, and they skip over all the regexp rules in case the pm didnâ€™t found anything</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:37:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I wonder why it wasnâ€™t just done with a skip actionâ€¦</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:37:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">functionally, the pm data file and the chains could be removed and the file would still work absolutely the same</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:37:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">just more regexps would run on all the output</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:38:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">so I think it was done for performance reason</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:38:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">since outputs are usually big</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:38:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That could be the case. But skipAfter would be much cleaner indeed.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:39:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ah, now I remember why.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:39:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">These rules are really old. Like seriously first generation, CRS1.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:39:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">really? I thought they were new in CRS3</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:39:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">at least the phrase match part</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:40:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And skipAfter is younger. In the beginning there was only skip-n-rules.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:40:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Really, they are so new?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:40:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I never really cared too much about the response rules, but they have been since the beginning, have not they?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:40:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">we did work on most of the lines formatting them, but they seem to originate at: Ryan Barnett Â Â Â Â 2014-02-17</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:40:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Or you mean they were re-designed right before we took over the project?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:41:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes I think this was work that went into 3.0</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:41:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Did not Ryan migrate to GitHub around 2014?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:41:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">they were still in base_rules/RESPONSE-51-DATA-LEAKAGES-SQL.conf by then, but have the new filenames</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:43:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">my ubuntu install seems to have still sybase so I could try to get some error messages from it. itâ€™s probably from the PHP sybase extension</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:43:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That would be nice. So you take on that issue?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:45:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">sure assign it to me! I think if people have loaded this PHP module, there is apparently some usage left, and it would not be a lot of work to make this regexp a bit more tighter. we just have to know how a sybase error looks. but Iâ€™ll probably get one when I try to connect to a nonexistent sybase server :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:45:33 UTC</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:46:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">could you forward that output to me by mail _@azurIt_?</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:47:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ok, I will try.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:47:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Iâ€™m wondering about the pattern. maybe you arenâ€™t using the sybase extension (which seems deprecated since 5.3) but maybe itâ€™s some PDO sybase extension</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:49:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ah phpinfo always contains DB-LIB (MS SQL, Sybase)	Wez Furlong, Frank M. Kromann, Adam Baratz and it also often contains some config values named warning so I can see how this goes wrong here :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:49:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Technically, we only have 1905 on the list, but let's skip that one. I will try and assign 1:1 after the meeting to somebody who did not participate.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This is an asylum for issues / feature requests we are too slow to implement. And the bots closes them.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:51:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Please go ahead Walter.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:51:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">oh thatâ€™s a good idea, or is it? why not keep them as issues?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:52:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">with issues people can vote and comment so we can reprioritize based on their input</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:52:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">or maybe someone responds with a brilliant easy solutuion that we havenâ€™t thought of</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:52:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Because they clog the issue queue and the bot assigns the stale label regularly and we need to remove it again and if we forget the issue is lost.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:52:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">canâ€™t we label an issue to have the bot stay away from them?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:53:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">or is that only temporaryâ€¦</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:53:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We could of course do that label idea.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:53:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">well, just an idea</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:53:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I donâ€™t like open issues either</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:53:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I just generally think there are issues at hand (typically FPs or new FPs) and more strategic feature requests.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:54:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">For me it's two separate things and administrating them both as "issues" feels wrong to me.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:55:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">we havenâ€™t earlier made a minor release, is that right? so Iâ€™ll work on adapting the release procedure wiki for the right procedure. (probably easy work)</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:57:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">is there anything I am missing that we should include?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:59:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We could look the the other merges and backport additional FP fixes.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:59:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ah, I remember the 3.1.1:
[https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/releases/tag/v3.1.1](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/releases/tag/v3.1.1)</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:59:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ah@</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:00:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">so [#1941](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#1941) moves some rules to phase:1 and [#1955](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#1955) (optionally) ensures blocking at the end of phase:1.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:01:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, I think you're right</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:01:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:01:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And we really tested 1941 extensively, so I think 3.3.0 and 3.3.1 are functionally identical despite the big change.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:03:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, it seems like a small operation. now the thing is timing. I wanted to start last weekend but felt I wanted to confirm with you the actual list of PRs to backport. now christmas is coming and nobody likes security releases around christmas..</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:03:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">would you want to write the blog about it, _@dune73_?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:04:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sure thing. I have already checked with NGINX. They do not want to communicate actively. So we are free to do our own schedule.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:05:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think the blog would not be so bad, because the issue is only really solved by enabling POST body access, which we should recommend anyway. our update is only really useful for those who canâ€™t do that, and even then itâ€™s not fully mitigating the issue. so itâ€™s a bit of a pickle to communicate this in a clear way. it should be top up front that if you use POST body scanning, this minor upgrade is not a priority for you. and maybe then itâ€™s not so bad to drop this during the holidays</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:07:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I agree. If we do not backport any other FP fixes we can tailor on exactly those who are affected.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:09:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think a 3.4 in the near future wouldnâ€™t be such a bad idea either. we have quite some nice FP fixes</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:10:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think it's time to close our meeting. Anything else?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:10:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">nope!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:10:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, 3.4 in Spring would be sweet.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:10:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">no.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:10:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:smile:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:11:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I will plan to do the backporting on wednesday, if it all goes perfectly I can make the release too, but it will take new bits of git wizardry so Iâ€™ll have to be very careful</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:11:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you Walter for doing the release!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:12:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Just for the confirmation, there won't be RC1 and RC2?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:12:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hmm, it might be good to do a RC1 for people to test</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:12:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">in that case we would issue the final release perhaps one week later (30 dec)</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:12:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, RCn would be fine</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:13:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">i'm voting for at least one RC.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:13:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I actually agree (given my experience with botching a release ...)</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:14:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, smart move</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:14:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">then we would release it on 30 dec and Iâ€™d actually have time to do it and co-write the blog also</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:15:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sounds like a plan.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:16:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">if you guys are here during the workday of 30 dec to proof read the blog it would make me a bit more confident</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:16:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">we are not going to do a CVE, right?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:18:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">then I have no further questions, your honor!</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:20:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">can we close the meeting?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:20:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think so. _@dune73_?</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:21:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sorry, do i have any tasks assigned?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:21:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I think [#1922](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/1922)</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:22:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ok, cool!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:22:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sorry. Lost connection there.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:22:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">thnx</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:22:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, Dec 30 sounds cool.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:22:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And no CVE!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:23:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you all for attending. And merry Christmas!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:23:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good night</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:23:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">merry Christmas!</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:23:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">good night!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:23:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">merry xmas!</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:24:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good night and merry Christmas to everyone!</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:24:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Merry Xmas, like in Futurama! :wink:</span>
