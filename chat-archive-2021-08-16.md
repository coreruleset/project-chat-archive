<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello, hello, it's time for our issue chat. Who's around?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good evening. I'm on holiday, but keeping an eye on chat via phone</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi there, good to see you all!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hello!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You still hiking _@Paul Beckett_?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi _@walter_!</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Not hiking in Peak District. Paddle boarding around Broads, although did walk over thirteen miles of the Norfolk Coastal Path yesterday</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">People do these paddle boards a lot on the Aare river from our village to Bern. 2-3 hours. Must be fun.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:39:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I have looked through last months issues, and litterally all 8 issues we talked about are still open (1-2 saw some action today and can be closed I guess). So I rescheduled them all and added 2 new ones. But that also means that there are new issues that came in since the last issue chat that do not fit our schedule.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:39:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Please see the agenda at:
[https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2169](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2169)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We used to be down to 23 open issues and it's 33 open ones again. This is to say, that are not very good at closing issues these days. It might be Summer, but we need to improve the rate again.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The thing that could be different might be that I let it slide myself as well. I've been quite active pushing issues along in Spring, but the last 2 months or so I've been busy on other projects. On the bright side, an important time eater comes to an end on Wednesday. So I hope that I will be better at keeping track of the open issues again.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes. due to summer and other co-founders away I am basically swamped with work. hopefully next week, they will be back and I will have some more time, like in the weekends…</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Don't overwork yourself, though. Health is important!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yeah, I try to keep the weekends free, but then there was the Olympics. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The Olympics were surprisingly interesting. Did not watch track and field for many years, but then they grabbed me hard this time. The suspense, the races, great stuff (also because Switzerland seems to become a top female sprinting nation with 2 athletes in the 100m final).</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">same here!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">my girlfriend is a real fan and she stayed up to 6am all day, then 8am I could take over the stick</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">let’s get rolling!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yeah.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So [#2162](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#2162) is our first one.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">A new FP. What do you think of my assessment?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I still think this rule detects this string quite as designed.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Reporter also asks "why not just look for angled brackets?" Do we just close or do we want to respond to that followup question?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;"><style type=css> could import some CSS styling, making “Pay now” buttons appear with evil actions</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Think so too.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">In general, HTML input needs to be excluded with a custom rule. There is simply too much evilness in it and there’s no way CRS is going to accept it.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We could weaken our defenses a bit, but still we wouldn’t attain the goal of making CRS work well with HTML.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I agree wholeheartedly. Could you write this up and close the issue, please?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:54:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Just pointing out that that is the rule that we're looking at because of ReDOS</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:54:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(hi everyone :slightly_smiling_face: )</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:54:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi Max!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You're talking of 941140, _@maxleske_?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Does this interfere with the problem of the reporter or is it just a coincidence?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@walter_ has closed this in the meantime. So anyways, let's move to [#2167](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#2167).
2167 is another FP, this time on a WP plugin. Submitter did not post his logs so far. I suggest we add the "need info" label and if it's not coming, we close in a couple of days / weeks.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Coincidence.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It seems that elementor is trying to PUT to a wp-json url. Elementor is becoming a more and more popular “Site builder” plugin for WordPress that basically allows users to create very good looking complex pages with minimal administrator effort. I would not be against including support for it in the package.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We’re using it ourselves on a few pilot projects now, so I might as well contribute anything I find to CRS.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sounds cool. So we keep this open and you try to work with what you are getting here as well as your own findings?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I could expand the WordPress package to include Elementor if you agree on this increase of scope. Sounds like not too much work for me.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm personally in favour of such an increase, yes.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Other opinions?</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think it's a good idea, we should add more popular plugins/themes.</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No one is using vanilla WordPress.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So I'm going to assign _@walter_ then.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:16:12 UTC</span>

Certainly not for such a rare occurrence as this. Also given "ping pong" is just fine. It's the ampersand or the line break that triggers in combination with ping pong.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">for me this would be ok. But it's not only for lowercase. There is an ignore case flag.</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sorry I hadn't picked up on the fact that ampersand was required for match. That strikes me as likely to be very rare in real usage unless someone has data to the contrary</span>
