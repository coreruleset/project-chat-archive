<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi _@maxleske_, hello _@Matteo Pace_. Good to see you guys!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">My personal calendar must have been so much out of sync. Being sick in Feb made me lose several weeks, so big astonishment there is a meeting tonight. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello all!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">it’s the age of sickness for some reason</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">How is your Covid coming along _@walter_?</span>

**JC** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ciao</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">maybe we protected so well for years that we’re now attacked by a wall of pathogens</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good evening</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey @jc and _@emphazer_!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">my covid is getting better, I can vape without coughing up a lung, still a bit weakish but it’s getting better each day</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I see Coraza got a party emoji as well...</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So great most people are here, maybe _@Paul Beckett_ joins us later.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Many of us missed the Community Summit in Dublin, which was a bit of a pity but those who managed to attend gave good feedback.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We have our own youtube channel now and the videos are online.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The videos were only uploaded today and _@xanadu_ noticed the sound and the video are out of sync. We'll see if this can be fixed.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">CRS pineapple pizza video tutorial when?</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">it's under preparation :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(The correct answer is never, of course‥)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Juan Pablo presented at our summit, but also at the conference. How did that go? Any of you attended? Is _@fzipitria_ here?</span>

**Matteo Pace** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It has been great! With _@fzipitria_ that did a cool clarification about Modsec (handled by one company) and a community project under OWASP like Coraza</span>

**Matteo Pace** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But overall pretty similar to the one “warm up” that they did during the CRS day :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Could you paste the link to said video in the OWASP channel, please?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:51 UTC</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Any other noteworthy talks at the OWASP AppSec conference?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Matt Tesauro on APIs was my favourite. Really good stuff. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nVZm69hmEE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nVZm69hmEE))</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(I planned to scout for interesting talks to invite to Swiss Cyber Storm, but that plan faltered.)</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So _@fzipitria_ gave 5 talks at AppSec Dublin, right?
He's a hero! I mean we already knew he is, but that's a lot of talks!</span>

↳ **JC** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">He is latino, so he talks a lot.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">2/3 of them with minimal preparation since I dropped out the day before ... :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh wow! :sweat_smile:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Atomicorp also ran a (online) conference lately. Did anybody attend that one?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">S**t happens</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Too much s**t for my taste this time ...</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">does s**t stand for snot?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:sweat_smile:</span>

**JC** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">s**t = stat?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Does not really make it any better ...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:49:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anyways, if nobody attended Atomicorp, then let's turn to the status updates. Quite a few of them missing. We'll have to ping people earlier. Sorry; my bad.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:49:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think the sandbox updates are noteworthy, since we had repeated problems with that in the past.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks _@theMiddle_!!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And then of course the fact that the bug bounty findings are all resolved.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@azurIt_ is working on an anti-spam plugin currently, which I think is super interesting; namely for hosters.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We're working on the crs-toolchain documentation; _@maxleske_ contributed another big chunk last week. This is really important since it makes development more accessible.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Other than that, everything is in the agenda, I think.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Questions on that topic?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If there are no questions, quick report on the numbers: 101 open issues, 16 open PRs (which I think is really nice, but we might have to clean up a few stale ones sooner or later). 4 security reports being tracked in the private report currently. 2-3 of them are mostly done.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We have a relatively new ReDoS report, but _@airween_ and I fail to reproduce it. Reporter is responsive, so maybe we can sort this out somehow.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(For the record: I'm talking of report U9P)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Let's turn to the open questions.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@theMiddle_ added "detailed changelog for integrators" to the agenda. Please explain the problem!</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">it's related to the test I'm doing on a couple of sites with the (not-the-latest-commit) 4.0-dev</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I've received some new FPs and it was really hard to understand what changed on what rules</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:58:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">git diff is useful, but not really understandable some times</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:58:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">With regexes it's close to useless.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It may be worthwhile to document all rule changes from 3.3.x to 4.0 for the release. But what an amount of work.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Namely since we do not really have systematic rule documentation.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">so for this reason, as an integrator, I would really appreciate if we can compile a "detailed" changelog</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">it's not mandatory to do it for the past commit</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">but if we start doing it from now, it would be helpful anyway</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We could also say 4.0 is kind of a fresh start and people will have to do the tuning anew anyways.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">for example: "added REQUEST_HEADER:x on rule 1234" it's a precious information</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sure thing. We might be able to automate that. But the regex changes? Very hard.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yeah one problem at a time</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:smile:</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">but "changed regex on rule 123 related to 999 issue" would be a big help</span>

↳ **JC** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Can that be obtained from commits with some sort of automation?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Where are we standing in this regard? I have no overview of the changelog right now. Is it viable to add that information for 4.0?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Better commit messages, for sure.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So like adding 'closing notes' to each issue. That's a great idea, but someone has to be responsible for summarising each issue.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm fact, we should at some point have a reasonable standard</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">uhm more than a commit message, it should describe the changes on a rule</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">for example, not "fix rule 1234 matching SQLi on User-Agent" but "added REQUEST_HEADER:User-Agent on rule 1234"</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Someone has to write all of those messages, though.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Someone with enough knowledge to read and understand and summarise each issue.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ideally such statements would be part of the commit message, then we could automate. But having a process in place for enforcing that will be hard.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We might be able to do so going forward. But having it backward for all the changes in 4.0 would be immensely helpful for integrators and users. But I do not see us achieving that.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Neither do I. We have to accept that we have a limited amount of resources.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Unless someone wants to be paid to do it...</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Exactly that. I've seen that enforced in private companies, but then the engineers are paid to do the task.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's someone's job at that point.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I spent some hours reading our commit messages, and they are really far from an understandable information about what changes are made on a rule</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:08:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's very tedious work. And it's likely to slow down development.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:08:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm not saying that is a problem...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:08:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe we have to accept the fact for 4.0 and look for a solution beyond.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:08:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@theMiddle_ I think you are absolutely correct with trying to make sense of Changelog.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:09:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Just for the sake of it: would we pay someone to compile that document for 4.0? If so, would one of us be willing to do it?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:09:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If we have somebody willing and capable to do it, I think that is a possibility, yes.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:10:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's hard to think of a non-developer doing that work, though, since you need to understand a lot of CRS to be able to write it. Or it takes a ton of coaching, which is also hard work.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:11:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">or can we limit to just few categories of changes?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:11:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I mean, adding variables, changing actions, adding transformation functions, etc...</span>

↳ **maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:13:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sounds like a sensible idea.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:11:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If CRS were a software company, we would simply change the ticketing system, right. To close an issue, you must complete a mandatory entry: "Rule change summary:" or whatever. If we did that to CRS today, no one would want to write rules and close issues…</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:12:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Process vs progress.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:13:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We can impose whatever rules we want. But every rule has side effects...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:13:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Namely the new ones.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:13:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">in Diesbach we discussed about rule comments. Wouldn't it be a solution that the rule developer makes a detailed comment, eg. appends the issue/pr number?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:13:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I also like the compromise position with the var changes etc.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:14:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@airween_: How easy is it to automate this to 80% and then complement the rest by hand? (like rule ID changes ...)</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:14:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@airween_ Even simple rules will have to be enforced by us, so I'm sceptical.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:14:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">okay, just was an idea...</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:15:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">idk if git diff and msc_pyparser combo could help us</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:16:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, that was my other idea</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:15:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We're talking about two different things though. I think what _@theMiddle_ is suggesting is to at least document some changes for the release. The process for writing commits and merging is a separate issue</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:15:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">exactly</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:16:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, that was my other idea</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:16:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, that was my other idea</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:16:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">My thinking goes into the same direction.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:16:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">documenting "critical changes on rule for integrators"</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:16:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It could be a separate document.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:17:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we have covered that topic for tonight. I suggest we continue to think about it for soem time. If somebody wants to come up with a draft: very welcome.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:17:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Next topic by _@theMiddle_: many referer and user-agent request header FPs 4.0</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That observation is correct. And it's because we see so many attacks on these headers (since log4j). But leads to FPs.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Does anybody have frequency numbers?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Like how many FPs on 1 million requests?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I haven’t been able to run it sadly</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:19:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Do you have you any hard numbers _@theMiddle_?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:22:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm collecting data for this problem, basically RCE and SQLi rules have an increment of FPs just because referer and ua. I'll create a detailed issue with more data. Sorry not having too much data to share, but I was curious to know if anyone else fall in the same situation</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:24:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I do not have enough traffic to see the extent of the problem. I had / have issues with Accept header, but they are now solved, then with Accept-Charset - about to be solved. UA and Referer far less.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:24:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(oh btw I'm testing on a couple of sites that do 1mil/day requests - total)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:24:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's the amount of traffic I'd like to see too.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:26:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So you open an issue and we can then see if there is anything we can do. Personally I am confident we can address FPs on the UA, but referer might be more difficult, since the payload is more diverse. But we'll see.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:26:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">2 open topics and we're done for tonight.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">With the bug bounty findings all covered, the 2nd remaining roadblock - and probably the hardest remaining one - is the update of the keyword lists used to inspect the requests. We have already decided we de-prioritize the response keyword lists.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I am grinding away with the list of bad UAs, making slow progress.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:28:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">How do we stand with the other keyword lists? What is still open?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:28:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I am hoping to attack the java keywords finally somewhere next week.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:28:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Meaning, find out the historiography of the existing entries, and adding some new ones I found in attack traffic.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:29:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Haven’t looked if there are CVEs for them, there might be zero days</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:29:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The overarching issue is at [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2621](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2621)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:30:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Java and UAs are the biggest junks, but there are quite a few individual open keyword lists too.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:30:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Does anybody like _@fzipitria_ have an overview or better understanding of the status?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:30:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I said I'd help with the list. I'm currently still cleaning up stuff that I had postponed. I'll see where I can help with the lists though.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:32:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The following ones seem to be unassigned:
</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:34:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If we'd be able to assign these tonight, the roadmap to 4.0 would be much more clear...</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:34:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Mostly the status is that people need to start picking things up</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:34:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">For the record: I have 5 UA / scanner items assigned to me.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:35:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I've taken the two RCE files</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:35:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There is one big PHP update</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:35:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If we do not find volunteers tonight, I can also try and talk to people individually during the week.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:36:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That _@azurIt_ was at least commenting</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:36:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I don’t know if he has the time, or the will to push it to the finish line…</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:37:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh no, Max took the 2 good ones :wink:. I can try and have a look at Windows RCE (932115).</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:38:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">lol :slightly_smiling_face: We can switch if you like</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:39:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Nono :slightly_smiling_face: I'll try my best with Windows RCE ;-)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:39:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_ is somebody working on the PHP update already?</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:48:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:39:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The restricted files and upload data also need some love ...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:40:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And there is really room for improvement with those two lists, I am sure.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:41:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'd see we leave it at this for the moment.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:41:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Which brings us to the final topic.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:42:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">t:htmlEntityDecode for 932115.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:42:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">See [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2998](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2998)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:43:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Azurit has done a draft PR and the 10 tests all pass. But Max and I are reluctant to accept this change. I think it's an invitation to try and sneak attack payloads that decode to benign data around the WAF.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:43:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The FPs are annoying, but potential false negatives would be even worse.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:43:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anybody has additional / contrary thoughts to add to the conversation?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:44:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">On the face of it, this is a standard false positive due to trying to pass arbitrary HTML through CRS. We usually expect that doing this will cause FPs and you need to tune them away. We wouldn't normally consider rule changes to accommodate this.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:44:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Somewhat arbitrary HTML, anyway. A subset of HTML.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:44:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think that freetext should not be fixed by us but by the user itself</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:45:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">HTML exclusion plugin?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:45:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You mean disable CRS? :stuck_out_tongue:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:46:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sounds as if we would agree...</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:47:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Wouldn’t be our normal reaction to advocate for a plugin that specifically punches a hole in CRS?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:48:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We're thus looking at a matrix rule exclusion plugin?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:48:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sorry, I'm driving</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:49:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@xanadu_ Is this really "Matrix"? You said in the comment that it channels different sources. That would make it hard to create a plugin for Matrix specifically</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:49:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I think this is its server-to-server API.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:49:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:51:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">libera.chat is the new Freenode, right? It's not impossible that they might have someone who would be interested in helping write a rule exclusion plugin.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:51:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Basically, if you're putting a WAF in front of Matrix you're asking for trouble anyway</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:51:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So we close the issue with a call to start an RE plugin and we offer some help?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:52:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would be happy to reply in the issue, assuming that doesn't tread on _@azurIt_'s toes :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:54:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Please do. I think you have the best grasp on the situation and I am sure _@azurIt_ will understand. You can also link to the chat.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:55:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Is there anything else for tonight? Did I overlook something in the agenda?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:56:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It seems we're good. So thank you all for attending. And hope to be back in two weeks with some keyword list updates!</span>
