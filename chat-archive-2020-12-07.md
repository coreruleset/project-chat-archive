**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@airween_, _@theMiddle_ and _@azurIt_ are also around. Very cool. Welcome.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I hope _@walter_ can make it too. I have not heard from him, though.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey!</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'll be around</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And here is _@fzipitria_! Hello!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So this is quite the crowd again. Very pleased to see you all.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We said last time that it would be good to work / coordinate between the meetings, also to ease things for people who can not really attend.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I struggled to do this for real, but when I did today, I realized how beneficial it is.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you for your work!!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Because we have now 10 PRs sorted out since the last chat. That's more than we have open for tonight (thanks to franbuehler for the agenda!)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So we dive right in?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yep</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I've arranged things in the agenda a bit to get kind of a natural order.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There are 3 PRs that address the build / testing environment.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">[#1934](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#1934) and [#1936](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#1936) both address the CI. Both have tests failing, so I am not sure they are ready to be merged.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_: A quick status perhaps?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No, those aren't</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We are working in two parallel things with _@fgs_ (he was moving this week)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">aren't ready?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK. So we leave this in your hands and move on. Thank you.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">One is for the annotations</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Let's move on</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Got that. The other one py3.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'll target them as ready</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">[#1906](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#1906) is a bit of a mixed bag.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yeah</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I like part of it</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But won't merge the nginx part yet</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_ helped me today, I hope I can review this one for next meeting</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There are 3 items and we do not like the first one. No 2 and 3 are simple bugfixes.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@airween_, you are talking about 1906?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you. Ideally before the next meeting, but nevermind.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yeah, I can be on top of it too</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But quickly: This brings nginx support for the test pipeline. At least partially.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But we do not really want this convoluted with Apache. Correct?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Well, I would be surprised if they work properly</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">you mean Apache for modsec3?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">no, it's completely unstable</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Nah, that won't work</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No, we do our pipeline on Apache/ModSec2 and he adds nginx configuration via this PR.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Or do I get this wrong?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I mean, we don't change configuration, we just use what it is there</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">IF this is needed, maybe that part of the PR should be against the docker containers</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I mean [https://github.com/coreruleset/modsecurity-docker](https://github.com/coreruleset/modsecurity-docker)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks. Could you please elaborate on that in the PR when you sort it out with the contributor. I would be pleased to have this documented.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sure</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">With 1911, we asked Federico for a review, but to be honest I was very, very late with this request and as we just heard, he is moving.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Assuming he can't be bothered with this, do we have another volunteer to take this over?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@theMiddle_? :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">he made a very good video on his YT channel about this attack :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And now he's not responding. So let's see what happens with the person we volunteered originally. And if that fails, I can always try and catch _@theMiddle_.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If we shift a lot of stuff to phase:1 and if we want to mitigate this problem for ModSec3 users, it would make sense to introduce and early blocking rule. Kind of a sibling of 949110 running in phase 1.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I suggest we would disable this by default, but make it an option to activate it. Like "early blocking".</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:13:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, without this early blocking, we still can't block since 949110 happens in phase 2 and is thus skipped.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:13:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So people running without bodyaccess in ModSec3 would have to manually shift 949110 to phase 1.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Earlier blocking is better. But it has consequences.
Like: You handle FPs that are being blocked and those FP requests suddenly add phase 2 and new FPs pop up.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:15:22 UTC</span>

**azurIt** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:19:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Looks like a big problem to me because if someone disables RequestBodyAccess (is it enabled by default?) it will also, 'secretly', disables huge part of the CRS (if i'm understanding it right).</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Finishing the early blocking discussion: I get the feeling you think it is worthwhile to do this. But as it might be problematic, we leave it as a default-off option for the time being?</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">although that may be a bit magic, we could use that logic in crs-setup.conf to enable it, as a changeable example</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:22:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">no it won’t be the same, but at least we could always do the early evaluation in that case</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:22:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">In that situation, I would perhaps stop execution (status 500) and refer to the option that should be enabled. But that is a very drastic move.
Generally, I do not think we should outsmart admins.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:22:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe there are patches around or people having a reason to run something in a certain way.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And the least we can do is log the fact that we think there is a vulnerable engine version and that "early blocking" should be enabled.
There are non-blocking setups up course as well. (via the DefaultAction) How to handle those?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:24:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We won't know the setting of RequestBodyAccess. We can only know the theory of it being vulnerable on the local engine version.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">no I don’t think we can evaluate that at the end of phase 1 where we would want the early evaluation to take place</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hmm. We could of course do this mechanism and at least report the problem in phase:5...</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I suggest to keep it simple: We make an optional early-blocking rule, we document it, we might even announce it with a lengthy explanation, but we leave everything else in the hands of the admin. I am afraid there are too many different edge cases otherwise and we might make a mistake and affect users in a negative way.

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would really prefer to do it that way. But I admit, I shied away from the TW discussion when this popped up and agreed to simply open the issue on their github (just to get rid of it). In retrospect that was too quick.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:45:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Looking at the issue underlines the point why these discussions are so time consuming. While Martin gets to the point quickly, Felipe just drags on and on without admitting there is a problem at all.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:46:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yep -sigh</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:46:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:46:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So we'll see what happens with TW and we continue our course.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:47:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think technically, this could warrant a 3.3.1 release with the backport of the phase shift and the new optional early-blocking? It's a bugfix, with a new optional rule, but no change of behaviour for the rest of the users.
The release notes could indicate this release is only really useful for ModSec3 users that run</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:47:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ReqBodyAccess off.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:48:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Optionally we could enrich it with more backports of FP fixes.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:48:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">good point, thiat would be very nice for us, if we have the resources</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:48:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Or we wait until the 3.4 in spring and do a blog post instructing affected ModSec3 users to run 3.4/dev (that comes with new FPs).</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:49:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">How much work would it be if we keep it minimal?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:50:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">what do you mean "minimal"? Only the phase shift?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:50:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">probably not too much, we could cherry-pick this diff to 3.3 (it would be a bit of git magic probably)</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:50:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">it’s more the release process which we have to be careful about as we didn’t do this earlier IIRC</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:50:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, only phase shift + early blocking _@airween_.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:50:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Plus some cherries on top.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:51:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">phase shift for 3.3 (stable) is about 15 minutes...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:52:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, we would need to do this professionally. But it could underline our point that we put the users first.
We insisted on a CVE in Summer when we came to the conclusion that we can not really help the community and a ModSec patch is needed. Here we go the simple route without the CVE since we can mitigate this ourselves for our users. The spotlight for the bug would still be on TW, but nobody could argue that we try to disrupt TW / ModSec3.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:53:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(And I heard that criticism from a small group of people.)</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:55:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can see where it might come off as that. But we have always been very graceful and waited long for them to solve things cordially. But not everybody might be privy to that.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:57:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we did the right thing and people reading our communication carefully will come to this conclusion, I think. But not everybody does and if we can strengthen our brand as a serious project with security in mind and do this with a timely and defensive release, then I think it would be a smart move.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:58:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Question is: Do we have the time / resources to do a release? You would be the natural release manager @Walter, but I do not want to press you; during Christmas on top.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:58:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">well xmas time is usually pretty quiet and I could do it</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:58:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">how can we start it? _@walter_ make a v3.3.1/dev branch from v3.3/master?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:00:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">but would it also be a good moment to release v3.4 simultaneously?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:00:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">probably not really necessary IMHO</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">21:00:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Let's wait for 3.4. So many things planned and so little time.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We have not really settled the sum 100% and I would rather not share the name of the company before a few administrative things are settled. But things look good at last.</span>
