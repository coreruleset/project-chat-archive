<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi there!</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello, welcome to the chat everybody.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi! :wave:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good see you all and a few people will join later.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Our agenda is at [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2675](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2675)</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good evening</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hello everybody!!</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@franbuehler_ would you mind writing down our decisions?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'll try...</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">thanks!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">thank you</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The last few chats moved to the private channel, but I would like to keep this one in the open. Also because the agenda does not mean to cover individual confidential findings / PRs, but rather our situation with too many bug bounty findings and how we could dig our way out of this.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:39:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes. Our todo list is grotesque and we are not making much progress. On my part this is because I am terribly busy with day job, we have trouble getting developers and I’m now back to programming 7 days a week.. So I haven’t finished any of my assignments… But it’s also a bigger problem I think. The issues seem so daunting and it’s very easy to get demotivated. We really have a problem as a project.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Similar situation here as by Walter. Fortunately, on last week I finished most tasks, and could start to care the BB issues</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">To add to the perspective: When we agreed to the bug bounty, we told our partner, that our project has the resources to process about two findings per week.
The bug bounty got us apparently more than a week of work in this calculation.
On top, we have an independent Indian researcher who keeps sending us bypasses. It must be over 100 of them already. It's really a lot and it feel overwhelming.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Most of us have a life outside CRS as well and of course there are day jobs that are demanding too.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">100 bypasses?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">In reality we are still merging 20-30 PRs per month, so we still get great work done, but it feels like a treadmill right now.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">How do you all perceive the situation?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The open issues queue is full of tonnes of issues with no one to fix them. It's daunting.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">For me it’s terrible, I have huge FOMO and feelings of guilt because I can’t find the time to work on it.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We have to think of some smart things on the short term and the medium term…</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@dune73_ would you mind if I shared a bit about our brain dumps?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@theMiddle_: We got another document on the weekend from him. And I did not dare to open it, admittedly. :joy:
Definitely over 100 already.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Not all of them are real, but all of them need to be assessed. _@franbuehler_ volunteered to tackle the doc with the first 78 of them.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That’s amazing, I wonder if she already regrets it :smiling_face_with_tear:</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I do :wink:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Well if you are behind on them you are in good company. We all seem to have a bit of the bug bounty disease.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That guy is like a shark who smelled blood :shark: :drop_of_blood:</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">but he tested them on sandbox?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And now he's in overdrive.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I test them again against the sandbox.</span>

↳ **theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ah ok cool, thanks!</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Is he interested in submitting pull requests to fix the bypasses he's found?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">but did he participate in BB program? Was he invited?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No, he is totally unrelated!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">He was not around when it started, but we have asked them to invite him for future editions.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ah ok cool, thanks!</span>

↳ **theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ah ok cool, thanks!</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">well, then his work is more appreciated :stuck_out_tongue:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">He actually agreed to help _@franbuehler_, but it's easier to find bypasses than to fix them for him... :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes you wrote a very nice letter for him to show the appreciation.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And I didn't ask him yet, to be honest.
I want to understand it first...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ah yes, I think that might help him land a job.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">IDK my approach to bypass notice would be a little different and less polite :smile:</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">but thanks for the work you're doing</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">if you need some help, let me know</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">He's super helpful. The first doc he shared was very hard to read. So I explained our situation to him and he resubmitted everything with curl calls.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That’s great!</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">nice</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So we are thankful and forthcoming too. But too much good can kill us as well.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But anyways this was just to add some additional dark color to the hole we're exploring.</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Are his issues individual rule bypasses? Or complete ruleset bypasses?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Individual bypasses AFAICS.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, individual.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">phew :smiling_face_with_tear:</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">and for what have you seen, are there bypass for whole PL2?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If I remember correctly, some PL2 yes.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ok that's bad :smile:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:56:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Business as usual, but not in light of the bug bounty (and in these numbers ...)</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:58:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Would it be useful to add the bugs (on Fran’s plate) in our big excel sheet? I can imagine it can feel a bit lonely to work on them alone and it could be good to ask for help or punt some issue to someone else..</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe when I have a good overview...</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">making an Excel could help creating that overview :)</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Google Sheet*</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you! I'll let you know, when I think I'm ready, ok??</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Feel free!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Some positive news: Felipe who has the best overview over the BB findings thinks that about half of them can be solved by updating wordlists.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Then there are many PRs merged already or close to merging.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And then there are duplicates.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So maybe it's looking worse than it is. But it looks really paralyzing right now.</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sorry I've missed a couple of meetings... Have we got the big PRs that would affect lots of rules merged in?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I think so. Or is there anything big open in this regard _@maxleske_ / _@xanadu_ (you probably have the best overview)?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm not certain. I'm busy feeling overwhelmed looking at the issues list :sweat_smile:</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I have no clue. I'm fighting with regexp-assemble.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:05:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I've helped merge a couple of the word list issues, but haven't seen any of the critical ones being handled.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:05:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I love how this quickly made script has gotten such a bright future.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:05:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Some are already done, some other lingering.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:05:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There's the one from Karel that I'm also working on, which is a toughy</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:05:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@Paul Beckett_ have you seen the Google spreadsheet? That contains the list of merged PR's (as I know...)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's true that we ought to find the original author of the perl library one day.</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Is it worth us considering trying to get all the small easy fixes out of the way? I know that's not a good vulnerability remediation approach, but might get us down to a manageable list that isn't so overwhelming?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We had this plan already, but to no avail so far.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:07:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would always recommend if you have a few hours time, to pick an easy one. But for now activity is low.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:07:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The observation is that even those finding marked "easy" and wiht the  declared goal to get them out of the way, they are not self-assigned.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">One thing is, it’s hard to develop rules without good tests. So we were thinking to organize a “special project”, which would have a budget of 5K, to create test files for all findings. This is an important task as it will give us more velocity on developing rules.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:13:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If somebody is interested in taking up this task, I think it will be a very good start to make the findings more concrete and less daunting.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:24:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, sort of… I have to finish projects at work, but I will have to learn to say ‘no’. I was thinking maybe at the start of August. That is usually a quiet time.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:24:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Again: Us leaders think it would be useful to give the test files away as a badge job and pay for it. To an individual developer or a team. Unlike the fixing, it's not directly rule related but it's cumbersome and distracting.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:24:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">and I'ld like to participate on virtual hackathon - but it depends on the date</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:26:59 UTC</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:27:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That’s absolutely fine. I’m not doing 8 hours a day also, there will always be fires I have to put out. But I can free up as much time as possible.</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:29:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@dune73_ I think it sounds interesting</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:29:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">it's school vacation until mid of August. So I could attend on Monday and Wednesday.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:30:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That sounds good :slightly_smiling_face: I propose we do it this way!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">However, in our chat, there is nobody volunteers to provide the YAML-files in time.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I might be moving house that week :see_no_evil: But if not then I should be free for at least a few of those days :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But chances are _@maxleske_ and _@airween_ come up with a tool that supports conversion of tests / curl calls.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If we are missing tests, time in the hackathon could also be used for that, although it would be helpful if it can be done (for 5K) earlier..</span>
