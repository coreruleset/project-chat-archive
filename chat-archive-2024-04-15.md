**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey, hey, time for the meeting. Who's around this time?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hey!</span>

**Matteo Pace** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey, Hello</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi!</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello, hello, good to see you all!</span>

**Edgars Voroboks** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Not sure if _@fzipitria_ is coming as well. We sure have 2-3 things to talk about.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe before we get going with the Agenda.</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello _@azurit_!</span>

**jit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OWASP is doing the project summit the time we would do our developer summit.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The time is far, far away in November, but they seem to be assigning beds to projects. So we kind of need to know how many of us will attend.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And we better know soon.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Are you all positive we are going and we'll be about the same amount of people, ideally with _@jit_ and _@Esad Cetiner_?</span>

##### Tue, Apr 16th, 2024

↳ **Esad Cetiner** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">01:14:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I won't be able to attend regardless unfortunately, I'd love to come though but it's just not possible for me at the moment.</span>

↳ **dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">05:20:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's a pity. Would have loved to see you on site, but I know the constraints and getting away for such a long period is hard.</span>

↳ **jit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">05:58:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sorry, I won't be able to come. Maybe next time.</span>

### Mon, Apr 15th, 2024

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm here</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Going where? To the OWASP summit?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OWASP summit == CRS summit</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">To the OWASP project Summit in UK.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm not sure yet</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I feel the dev retreat is very important and very productive. If we join the official OWASP summit and then we are less productive because some of us don't feel like attending, then that's a bummer.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:38:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">On the other hand, if we insist on a separate retreat, the project might get into trouble.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:38:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's why I think it would be the best to join, but it really depends on all of you.</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:38:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Why we are going to be in trouble?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If I come it'll be for CRS, not OWASP</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We are not a legal entity. We are a branch of OWASP. The money we are "earning" via sponsoring goes into a pool. So far, there was an understanding, we are at liberty to take the same amount out of the pool, but the person overseeing this has left their job at OWASP HQ.
Now OWASP got a deal to book an entire resort. If we want a separate hotel, this is likely more expensive and they can simply say no and then what do we do?</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Are there no $$$ for a retreat?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The $$$ is at OWASP.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If I come, it will be for CRS too, but there will be some minimal overlap. This can be fruitful, but also distracting of course.</span>

**Matteo Pace** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There might be also some pros being around other Owasp people, dont you think so? As far as we keep a proper autonomy on working for CRS for most of the time</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I mean the people from the other projects attending are really great and some of the best appsec people out there. But it's a distraction and it's not the family feeling of a dozen people. More like 70 people queuing up for the Jacuzzi.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I have already informed OWASP, that we will want to keep separate to a wide extent that we will want to do separate outside activities. Happy to insist there. But it's still going to be a distraction. But of _@Matteo Pace_ is right, there are real pros around.</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would like to meet some owasp folks.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So I see most people are positive and _@maxleske_ is unsure?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">In my experience, aside from having some shared meals, we will be working mostly on our own</span>

**Matteo Pace** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If it is like we have our own meeting room and our own activities, and then the whole hotel is full of Owasp guys instead of random people, it doesn't seem to be bad</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It is a big cabin. Open doors.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If someone wants to say hi, and work on the project, like here, we will welcome anyone</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Other than that, again, we have our own agenda. In previous summits we even didn't see people from the MASVS project.. and they were working hard out there.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK, I'll get back to Lauren then. Likely they will want us to register pretty soon.
_@jit_, if you want to join, it's time to get a passport!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's easier for you this time, since it's UK, so no Schengen Visa!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Our agenda is at [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3636](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3636)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">First item: Do we want to put `Mozlila`on the list of dangerous vuln scanners? The only rule left in the 913 rule group.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's definitely used for nefarious purposes, but we really trimmed down the list to the dangerous stuff and I always thought this one was not overly evil.</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would add it.</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's definitely something malicious.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So on the bases, that there are no known positive uses.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Other opinions?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:54:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Apparently not. So let's add it then!</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Looking at the provided link in the issue it appears to be a simple measure against a host of automated attacks. Probably a good idea.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The next one is fairly complex: [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/pull/3650](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/pull/3650)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@azurit_, could you explain this idea briefly?</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:56:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Every single user, who was new to exclusions rules (and shraed his/her work with us), was excluding also blocking rules without knowing what that means.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:58:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">-> 949110 and friends</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Also, internet is full of instructions to exclude them, wrote, probably, by someone, who don't know CRS very well -  there is even a security tool (somewhere on the google link) which is recommending to remove 949110.</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I thought it would be a nice idea to warn a user that something wrong has happened to his/her CRS installation.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Could be separate this into a "best practice checker" or something? I love the idea but don't particularly like it as part of the core rules</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@dune73_ Are your blogs about exclusion rules warning about NOT excluding blocking rules?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_Could be separate this into a "best practice checker" or something?_ - there is a task on my todo list that make a script which checks the settings of a ModSecurity instance, eg. check `SecRuleEngine` state, log files and so on... that should contain this</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The script I am hosting to generate rule exclusions refuses to generate a rule exclusion for a blocking rule, but explain the situation.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And I think my tutorials explain this too.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But of course, other tutorials don't.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I am also not overly keen on this additional check. I mean if you flush all the rules on a firewall, everything is open too.</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@maxleske_ dune's tutorials are doing so and it has little effect, as we can see. Will it work if we do the same in some other documents/recommendations?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But where you get me is a RE with a path constraint (-> run time RE), where everything is in order, but you have a backdoor for a specific path, because the path disables 949110. I think that is really hard to spot otherwise.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Counterargument: Who would read your new log entries, if they are n00bs?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So honestly, I do not know.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ok. Alternative: make that "dev mode". When your done tuning and are sure that the WAF is active, you can turn it off. The message in the log should say so too.</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe we can do the same by othe way - something like, adding 'DO NOT EXCLUDE THIS RULE' into message logged by 949110 and similar rules?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Can you elaborate on this _@maxleske_. I do not get it.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:07:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This is the current message as proposed by _@azurit_: `ATTENTION, FIREWALL IS DISABLED!!! At least one of the blocking evaluation rules was not executed (Inbound early blocking evaluated: %{tx.inbound_early_blocking_evaluated}, inbound blocking evaluated: %{tx.inbound_blocking_evaluated}, outbound early blocking evaluated: %{tx.outbound_early_blocking_evaluated}, outbound blocking evaluated: %{tx.outbound_blocking_evaluated})`</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:08:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Imagine that we always print this or `The WAF is properly configured. Well done. You can turn off this message by setting ....`</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:10:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But everyone will disable that message immediately after installation and configuration. And, after few days, will add a new exclusion rule..</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:10:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Think so too, namely the 2nd part.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:10:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's disabled by default.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:16:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's my thinking too _@fzipitria_, but honestly our scoring mode is more complex than the iptables blocking.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:17:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we won't come to an agreement on this question tonight. Shall we take more time to think about this and then take it into the Agenda in May again?</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:26:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh, CLI.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:26:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You could used it to download the exploit kit.</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:26:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Nevermind.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:26:28 UTC</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:27:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's tricky.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:27:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anybody has an idea how to prevent this FP?</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:27:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Do you mean other than moving it into higher PL?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:28:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:29:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I do not think we can give it separate treatment (-> http or ftp URL) in this context.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:29:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">do we want to care only with **this** issue? As wrote above, the reporter of this issue sent 2 other FP's last week.</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:30:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We need to resolve all of them, of course.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We need to handle them individually. And I doubt we want to discuss them all tonight. Pushing the FP into a higher PL might be the go to solution, if we have added command line context already where it's an RCE.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'll have to look at them with more time.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">He employed something like fuzzing to discover these, did not he. I mean it's not a new installation and he got these FPs within the first 2-3 days.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Although `Axel Smith` is going to happen from time to time in the real world. It's a common first name in Germany. (But only in Germany. :slightly_smiling_face: )</span>

**azurit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think he was just reading the code and thinking about the keywords, probably didn't hit them in production. But he is right that those are real-world words without IT/security context.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Definitely a welcome contribution.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">what about _@xanadu_’s quantitative testing project?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That will hopefully make such individual FP reports diminish over time</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Will trigger as soon we expand to biggest German media enterprise "Axel Springer" makes the headlines.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This will generally help as we move forward.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">With the 3.x release line, we got less and less FPs throughout the years. It will likely be the same with 4.x unless we overhaul rules and find new sources for them.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So _@maxleske_ volunteered to take a closer look. Anybody interested to join him?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I can help.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Cool. Thanks.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Finally, the docker hardening.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So I did an assessment of our Apache Alpine container with the CIS Apache Benchmark in hand.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Apparently, this is not meant for Docker, but a lot applies. And a lot is questionable.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We are running a doc with the discussion at [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Li2LNSWXSAKOHr5VmO0UgEyMsFQO-Cb915S69GiJ1Lo/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Li2LNSWXSAKOHr5VmO0UgEyMsFQO-Cb915S69GiJ1Lo/edit), but so far only _@fzipitria_ checked it out.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">More eyes welcome.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But what is visible already is a policy decision.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I personally think everything that is not needed should be removed.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_ seems to think (based on his comments in the doc), that everythign that can not obviously be exploited should be left as per default (=distro apache).</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Typical example: cgi handler, default cgi scripts, etc. Hard to exploit, since we proxy everything, but why leave it laying around waiting for a silly mistake / exploit that leads to them being execute.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So the question is: What should be the policy here?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I agree with both of you :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you. I feel confirmed.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But in the context of our project, I feel it is more important to focus on maintainability than on providing a "secure httpd".</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anything we change we will have to maintain.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Providing a "secure httpd" would be great but that's essentially a separate project. If there were such a thing, then we could use it to base our images on. That would make much more sense.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:49:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I agree, this is a strong take on the question.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:49:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Unless we want to throw money at the problem...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That could be an option, but maybe only at a later stage.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So you think we should do the low hanging fruit and then make it transparent, where we did not harden?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">...***if we should harden**</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anybody wants to take a stand to make this as hard as possible by default?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK, so I will try to get the low handing fruits sorted and then maybe add documentation to talk about hardening.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think that's a decent compromise even if I have a knack for very hard systems.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anything else for tonight?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, a small thing</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Everyone who has changelog prs assigned to them with a ton of commits and conflicts, I will take care of them. I just need _@dune73_ and _@fzipitria_ to look at my PR.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:58:17 UTC</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:58:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's all</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This means we always get a week to merge the previous changelog? And if we do a release, we speed it up with a manual call?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Pretty much. But the PRs will be bigger and include more PRs</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, definitely. But the week will help. Even if I liked the simple ones.</span>
