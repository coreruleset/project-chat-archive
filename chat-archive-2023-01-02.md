**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:30:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ciao a tuttз!</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hola a todos!</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi guys, happy new year!</span>

**Dennis Brown** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:wave:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey, hey, nice to see you all.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Welcome to our chat _@Dennis Brown_!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Happy new year!</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">good evening</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi all</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">happy new year!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anybody heard anything of _@Paul Beckett_?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And I see _@Matteo Pace_ is also here. Hi!</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">bella Matte :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**Matteo Pace** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi everyone! :blush:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So _@franbuehler_ announced she is likely to be late. I have my daughter with me in my office (and she is not sleepy at all) and here is our agenda: [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3037](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3037)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_, _@walter_ and I had a call prior to our meeting and we have a plan. For the release. But we'll keep up the suspense, I guess.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:smiling_imp:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Then let's get going.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:tada:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You have seen the status updates in the agenda. What I'd like to highlight is the very welcome Caddy & Coraza setup tutorial. I've been missing that and I think it makes Coraza mcuh for accessible for the rest of us.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I reckon we share the feeling of a stalled development. This has a lot to do with the bug bounty findings and how we can not really get them done.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yet there is some light. _@maxleske_ is confident he can finish the update to the 932150 rule within the next week or so. That change is supposed to kill most of the remaining bug bounty findings.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We will then need to review and merge it to get a clear picture of the remaining tasks for 4.0 RC2.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@maxleske_ did I sum this up correctly?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">At least I do not see any objections. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Unfortunately, we did not publish a SQLi+JSON blog post as planned. (If you remember that vuln from early Dec 2022). But _@theMiddle_ might follow suit with a sandbox challenge.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Who is ready to review the PR 3061 for 932150 once it's done?</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'd like to make sure we are not losing any time on the review.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK, I'll take a bite. But I think we need a 2nd reviewer as well.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">My health sucks a lot but I would like to take a quick look for false positives (common English words removed)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK, so we have _@fzipitria_ and me plus _@walter_ casting an eye with regards to FPs. Thank you.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So assuming we have 932150 updated and only 2-3 minor BB issues remain (that will solve themselves overnight as they usually do), the 2nd big blocker for 4.0 RC2 is key word lists that are not really progressing.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">In our separate call, we explored the idea to split them into 2 categories:
</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_ is now tagging them.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The good thing is most REQUEST keyword lists are done and these are the more important ones.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So our idea is now to get the REQUEST keyword lists done before RC2. If RESPONSE keyword lists are merged before RC2 then cool, but we will not wait for them. So finalizing all the lists would be postponed for 4.1.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What do you think?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Just to make it more clear, from [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2621](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2621)</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The scanners/crawlers are in the works. Plus the php functions</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Also the windows commands</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">sounds good. Also because RESPONSE block rules only affect modsec v2 users (and maybe coraza?)</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We are postponing anything that affects response rules</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And because most of the lists will be used by PL1 users, that not necessarily will use response rules by default</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Exactly.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Are we missing something with this reasoning, or does anybody have any objections to this?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@franbuehler_ can you get your 2nd bypass PR merged in parallel with this work as well?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think so, yes, but I'll have to check with _@maxleske_... But that should be possible.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So I guess that's our plan for now. I hope we see clearer in our mid-month meeting with BB almost, like really almost done and a clear tasklist for RC2.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Then let's attack the other project discussions.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Audit log parts.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There are a few rules that change the audit log behavior, issuing a logparts+E.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's definitely not systematic the way it is. And it's probably highly problematic because we are likely logging sensitive information in certain situations.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So what do we want to do about it?
</span>

↳ **theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">remove all +E</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@theMiddle_ you mean from everywhere, or just from new rules?</span>

↳ **theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">from everywhere</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">LogPart E can be removed. I never used it for tuning. It only uses log space.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:08:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@airween_ do you see reasons to keep it around?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:09:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">no, I also do not use them. I just asked because the check-rule-script.py has a step where it checks that ctl:autitLogParts=+E is at the last rule if it's a chained. But if we remove all of them, I can change this step that we disallow it in the future</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:10:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">In absence of any other opinions, team removal wins.</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:11:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">right, and can we agree not to allow it in future?</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:12:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">or we keep the door open if someone needs it...?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:11:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">@fzipi points out in 3034, that we need to document this, plus the said config example. Who can do this?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:11:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(I don't want to add more problems, but it's also a problem logging REQUEST_HEADERS:Cookie but I think there isn't an easy solution for this)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:14:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This is a problem, but so is every alert message. And we're out of options there as far as I can see.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:15:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We have a bit of a controversial PR [#2948](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#2948): It's about our process to delete stale issues.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:16:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Right now, our bot tags stale issues for closing. If nobody reacts, they are being closed after a grace period.
The idea of the PR is to only do this if we wait for information from the reporter.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:16:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Our current process means we are closing issues that should be fixed (but we do not have the time / interest to fix them in a necessary timeframe).</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:17:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But this has the advantage to keep the number of open issues smaller.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:17:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_ stated in PR that there was a dev retreat decision to adopt the more defensive approach proposed by the PR.
_@xanadu_ disagreed and stated it was discussed, but not decided.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I vaguely remember there was a discussion on Hacker News that auto closing issues is toxic</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think _@xanadu_ is correct.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:18:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ideally we should only close when unsuccessfully waiting for input from the reporter.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:19:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Personally, I think auto-closing issues is really bad. But suffocating under the load of too many issues is even worse from my perspective.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:19:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's a tough choice.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:19:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I agree. It could still be nice to tag old issues as "stale" though</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:19:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It is not for all issues!</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:19:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Only for the ones waiting feedback</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:20:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Agreed</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:20:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If we can do that with a tag ‘awaiting feedback’ could the bot limit itself to those tickets?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:21:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's exactly the PR, _@walter_. Or am I wrong, _@fzipitria_?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:22:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">am I reading it well? after 30 days -> stale, and after 44 days -> closed?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:23:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(only if tagged awaiting feedback)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:24:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No longer sure I get this correct.
All other issues would not be closed automatically anymore. Correct?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:24:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Exactly</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:24:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">if yes, I think we should change the message too</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:24:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">at line 16</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:25:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I’m sorry but I have to drop out of the chat. I slept 5 hours today and I had a really rough day. I’m almost unable to read the chat anymore. I trust you to make the best decisions.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:26:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Have some good rest, _@walter_!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I’ll try :slightly_smiling_face: Gonna sit on the couch with some relaxing music on my headphones, and then to bed early.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Goodbye evertyone</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If I read this correctly, it's only _@xanadu_ and me that prefer the current behavior.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:28:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I am really afraid, we will be overwhelmed with issues we are no longer solving.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:28:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Here is a proposal. We try this new approach (-> merge the PR) and we reconsider six months from now.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:30:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_ what do you think?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:31:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm going of with it</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:31:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ugh</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:31:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm good with that</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:31:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(started a little review for the message)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:31:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you. So let's review and merge the PR then.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:32:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Final topic for tonight, if I'm not mistaken: Plugin tests.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:32:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We already decided they do not have to be done for CRS4. But we still need some kind of plan to get it sorted out.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:34:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I see a central question being if it's up to the plugin "owner", or something we address as a project.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:34:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">exclusions plugin should be """easy""", I mean it's something like a regression test but needs a positive and a negative test
other plugins that adds functionalities maybe requires more logic</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:35:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Agreed. But it's still work and we need to have a plan.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:37:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">One approach that might work would be to introduce a "test coverage" column in the plugin registry (-> none, minimal, reasonable, complete) - and one year from now or so we could remove the "official" brand from plugins that are not meeting the "reasonable" standard.
That way test coverage would be decentral in the hands of the plugins, but still transparent to the users.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:38:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Opinions?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:39:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I like this idea.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:41:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_ also brought up the idea to pay somebody for this job. Do you think that is something we should try? (again, we generally do not liek to pay for rule writing as an OSS project, but this work seems relatively boring - and still needed)</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:43:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Where? Did I?</span>

↳ **theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:44:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">lol</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We can do this as a plan "B" if plan "A" (column in plugin registry) is not successful.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:44:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Are we talking about the exclusion plugins now? Because the more complex ones are probably the ones we should take care of ourselves.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Realistically, who is going to do this work?
This task needs a person responsible for it or it won't get done. It looks like an enormous amount of work. Should we pay someone to do this project? Last year we had budgeted money for 'projects' that we did not use. Open for discussion.Was not that you?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:44:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sorry if I mis-attributed this.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:45:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Not me :sunglasses:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:45:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@maxleske_ we're talking about all plugins.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:45:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sorry, man.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:45:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Then who wrote this? :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:46:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think the only problem is that it's time consuming and boring :joy: maybe I'm wrong but I don't think it's a complex task</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:48:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So we try out the column idea and let it roll for some time?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:49:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">but can we have a policy for all new plugins that has to be published with tests?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:50:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Just in case, I've wrote exactly what needs to be done in the agenda</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:50:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Very good description.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:51:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we would definitely ask for tests in 3rd party plugins. And we can adopt that rule for new plugins too.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:51:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">With this off the table, I feel like we are mostly done for tonight. Anything else?</span>
