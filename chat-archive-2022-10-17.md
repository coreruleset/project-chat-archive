<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi!</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">good evening</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi guys, and welcome _@Dennis Brown_, very nice to see a new face here.</span>

**Dennis Brown** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">cheers!</span>

**Ignacy Osetek** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Dennis wrote in last week and asked how he could help the project or the ModSec community at large. I suggested he joins the ride and starts with one or our meetings.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello _@franbuehler_ and hi _@Ignacy Osetek_, welcome to our slack and meeting!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So we are going to talk about a few issues tonight and then the upcoming developer retreat starting on Oct 29. There are still a few open questions there. So I hope _@theMiddle_ joins us as well since he is the key organizer on that front.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_ you made the following call on the dev channel: "Let's try to close those issues with easy fix so we don't carry too much to the dev retreat"
Is this about the bug bounty findings or more general?</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">In general</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So we have less to fix for v4 in the retreat, and we can focus on the complex stuff we still need to do</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hey! I'm here</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hello everyone</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">In general is going to be tough. We have so many open issues right now due to the bug bounty distracting us. It will be a hell of a fight to lower that number again.
But I agree, every closed issue is an issue less.</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hello everybody!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi _@emphazer_!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:38:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I suggest we start with the issues and turn to the retreat afterwards. Ideally, we take 60-90 minutes for the meeting.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:38:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So the agenda is at [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2823](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2823)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:38:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If you scroll down a bit you encounter the issues highlighted for tonight. Let's start with [#2839](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#2839).</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:39:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@Ignacy Osetek_ you opened this two weeks ago. Could you or _@fzipitria_ summarize the situation / state of discussion briefly?</span>

↳ **Ignacy Osetek** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I will summarize it  in a moment</span>

↳ **Ignacy Osetek** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:50 UTC</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If Ignacy is not around, I can try</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Waiting then</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK, wel postpone as this problem is not unheard of in CRS circles.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">[#2848](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#2848), then.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Apparently, this use of possessive quantifier slipped into our rule base and now we need to get rid of it again.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, this is hurting Coraza</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">About the password leakage: I think this would be quite interesting as a plugin, but as the issue already says, it will only cover badly stored passwords (not salted)… That said, we are rebuilding an app from scratch, and the old app developers (not us!!!) had just md5'ed the passwords. I tried John the Ripper and I got an amazing 75% of the users’ passwords within minutes. :face_palm: So, bad password storage is definitely out there. It could be a great plugin. I’m worried though about the performance, how many passwords and hashes could go into a @pmFromFile before performance becomes unbearable?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Do we need to check all of our regexes? Or is this just a simple mistake and everything else is fine?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Can we automate checking for possessive quantifiers?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Actually, I thought we had this in lint, but maybe that was just wishful thinking.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@airween_, can we get this in lint?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">sorry, lint for what? For regexes?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We don’t have, it is planned</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Got you _@fzipitria_
_@airween_: Lint to detect use of possessive quantifiers and lookaround and what not.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We have an issue open for that</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ah, thanks. Sure, we need to write a regex pattern which checks that the other regex (subject) does not contain that quantifier</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Juan Pablo was going to work on it</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We have a list of what is forbidden, if it helps:

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Easy: we need to check regexes against re2</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">as I know, Python also has re2 module. It that's compatible the "original" re2, then we are done</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That list should be up to date.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_ Sounds like a very pragmatic hack.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK, so the linting will be covered in a breeze. But can we simplify the regex here?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">that is the part that needs to be taken care of</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This is coming from both _@Karel_ and _@maxleske_ if I recall correctly</span>

↳ **Karel** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:54:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What are you referring to here? _@fzipitria_</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ready!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:12:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Which brings us back to [#2839](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#2839) and the proposal by _@Ignacy Osetek_</span>

**Ignacy Osetek** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:12:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">As for the topic created by me:
I created a ticket 2 weeks ago about extending DATA LEAKAGE rules to include potential password.
My approach was to detect a few popular passwords and their hashes in the response payload.
The approach depends on the fact that in most of the databases there is always someone, who will create a password qwerty, 123456789 etc.
The discussion is not over and _@airween_ pointed that it is too generic solution to him.
I think it is worth a shot to create a rule which detects a certain amount of popular passwords in the response body as it may prevent an actual leakage.

To avoid false positives with plain text, there would be a requirement, that single payload must contains at least 2-3 suspicious words. "123456789" and "qwerty" in a single payload may be a good grief. The single hash, on the other hand, is much more suspicious so single appearance of qwerty123 hash should stop the traffic.

This solution won't work for more secure database administrators, which use salt and pepper as they don't hold plain hash of popular password. For these users I have another, a bit more complex idea as it requires one additional step from them.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:13:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think it's an intriguing idea, but I wonder what the overlap between "systems with cleartext/unsalted hashed passwords" and "systems running CRS in a hard blocking mode with PL2 or higher" is.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:13:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Do we have a 'counting' mechanism like this? Maybe with Lua?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:13:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Unless I'm forgetting something.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:14:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I was thinking of that as well _@xanadu_. We do not have an easy counting mechanism and certainly not on the same parameter.</span>

**Ignacy Osetek** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:14:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If I recall correctly we can make a rule depending on the status of second rule</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:14:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So we might have to resort to LUA - or we duplicate the RESPONSE_BODY variable in tx.RESPONSE_BODY_COPY and chain it all together.</span>

**Ignacy Osetek** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:14:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">and I believe there was some counting in ModSecurity operators</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@Ignacy Osetek_ you seem to be interested to try this out. Would you also try it in a plugin?</span>

**Paul Beckett** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:17:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I also wonder how useful it would be in preventing leakage, as attacker might well chunk the output as a large database might be rather big to dump in one request. I could see it being potentially useful if combined with a Honey Credential, but that would require the admin to seed the honey account/cred in the target system.</span>

**Ignacy Osetek** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:17:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The reason why I was thinking about making it a part of base core rule set instead of plugin is that this is a good detector for simple databases</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">sandbox requires a lot of improvements and new challenges, IDK if it worth working on it during the retreat. Also, I think it would be helpful to makes our wordpress plugin grown in terms of "functionalities" since a lot of websites are made with WP</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We already spent a full week doing Bug Bounty findings, do we want to do another week?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Or maybe just the "hard" "unfixable" ones?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's a grind.</span>

**Karel** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">A healthy balance between difficulty / severity maybe?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The problem with the BB findings is that they are preventing us from releasing v4. So it's kind of a must do.</span>

**Karel** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe a good way to look at it is: The easier the problem, the more likely it is to be "fixed by someone else"</span>

**Karel** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">or even a new contributer, perhaps</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I agree it's definitely a grind. So we need to make sure it's not loaded on 2-3 poor souls but at least shared evenly on all shoulders.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I was actually thinking more about the sandbox than about BB. As _@theMiddle_ said, it needs to be done but probably isn't much fun.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We should at least clear out the "invalid" BB issues before the retreat.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Get the numbers down a bit.</span>

**Karel** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'd be down for that</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There is a lot of automation that we can/should be doing</span>

↳ **Karel** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'd love to help with that. Is Go an option here? :sweat_smile:</span>

↳ **unknown user** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Do you mind to come up with ideas as issues?</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We will. Do not worry about that.</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I have way more ideas than hands.</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@Karel_ It is. We are replacing most of what we can for Go equivalent stuff. So definitely a YES.</span>

↳ **Karel** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Well, that's literally my comfort zone, now we're talking! :laughing:</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:11:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You’ll be very confortable then :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That is fun and needed</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@xanadu_ and _@Karel_ would you guys be able to look through the open findings to determine which ones can be considered invalid? Anything we know we do not have to cover is a big relief and I agree 40+ findings in Italy would be tough.</span>

**Karel** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sure!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you guys.</span>

**Karel** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">When is something considered invalid? I was expecting the bad apples to be filtered out at report-time</span>

**Karel** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We can always discuss this later, if you want</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">How about 1h of bug bounty findings as a large group every day? That way we share the workload, we get a joint feeling of accomplishment and it's not too much.</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">we should do that in every morning.

Instead of coffee... :stuck_out_tongue:</span>

↳ **xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:49:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But by the end we'll want to go back to sleep :sleeping_accommodation:</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That's a good idea.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That sounds good, then we can think of strategies and distribute, and then they could be worked out individually afterwards (the hard ones), and then another moment where we evaluate</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:49:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_, _@theMiddle_ and I losely agreed to do an agenda call to pick the projects we really want to work on. Is there anybody who wants join that call?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Since I’m still sick and can’t work a lot I’m not sure I will be a very big contributor, but I always like to see you, so count me in</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I might join. Let me know when it's on</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(We could this as a big group call, but based in my event organization experience, it is better to design an agenda than taking votes and ending up with an unbalanced result)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Now for the excursions.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@theMiddle_ you told us with Milano within reach, this would be easy. But I have not seen many proposals.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I really liked both the guided museum tours last year</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So much better than strolling without guidance</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">nope indeed :smile: I'm just worried about moving to milano could be hard without 2 cars</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">but could be done it's not so far</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think our project really enjoys museums and culture (vs. parties and fun parks)</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There's room for both! :smile:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We'll rent a car if it need be. Or taxi. We have the funds. No problem.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The aqua park idea was voted down last year.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ok but what about booking, it's something like each one of us buy a ticket for something we decide to do?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So _@theMiddle_ could you get tickets for the Last Supper and a guided tour for the Domo on Monday afternoon?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No, please do a booking for the entire group.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">monday afternoon for both?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And book a table for the dinner, possibly a bar first?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:55:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Delle Grazie at 15:00, Domo at 17:00?</span>

↳ **theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">let me check, it sounds like a little bit closed one to another but maybe I'm wrong</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ok not near the duomo, or I need to leave my car for pay the dinner :smile:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:56:41 UTC</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes the Naviglio</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Depends how much else we look at around the Supper. From the monastery to the Domo is doable in 30min, I guess.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Either way, what do we do with the remaining 9 people on Friday?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We can also take a boat on Lago Maggiore to the Borromean islands, but they are wildly touristic - yet beautiful. But I wonder what else we could do.</span>
