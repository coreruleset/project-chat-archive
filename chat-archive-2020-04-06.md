**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hellooooooo!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">how is everybody? and how is the COVID¹⁹ situation over there?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm greeting you from the Folini house construction site. We moved to the upper floor (where we also do home-schooling when the noise and our 20month gold Giovanna permit).
Hello everybody!</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi all</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">great timing for a remodeling!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">When I said I wanted to spend more time with my family in 2020, the Covid stuff was not what I had in mind.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">lol</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">haha, try not to feel guilty about it, all the young parents I know are saying the same</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi!!</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hello</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We started the renovation 2 days before the government started to close down stuff. But construction can still continue where we live, so good for us. But there are too many kids with too little space in our house now.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If Corona is not killing us, home-schooling will. :wink:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">TheMiddle told me he is doing OK despite living in Northern Italy. Is anybody from our team really affected outside of a life turned upside down?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">no urgent situations I guess :slightly_smiling_face::+1:</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:38:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">just the work progress I upside down atm</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:38:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No, we are not affected. We are still healthy</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:38:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@emphazer_ Did you actually return to work in early March, or how has it been going for you?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:39:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">thanks God, it’s good to read that you’re all ok</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:39:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yeah everything is fine. but you know I work for the government and it's crazy at the moment</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">55hour week last week</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">more work from home -> less free time (less CRS/ModSecurity) :disappointed:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh, oh. 55 hours is a lot. And you are also busy _@airween_...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I wonder how the situation in  Uruguay is? Brazil seems to be getting worse and worse, while things have stabilized somewhat in most European countries (for the time being).</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Here we are in quarantine (not 100% strict). Way better than Brazil & Argentina</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">As you probably have noticed, the AppSec conference in Dublin has been cancelled (/postponed to 2021). So I do not think it likely we will meet in June in Ireland. Maybe we can make it work in autumn somwhere.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">it would be nice</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, that would be nice!</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You mean virtually?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">More physically. But maybe we should stick to the summit idea and do it virtually. What do you think?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That way we could also keep the date: June 17.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We are now used to do meetings virtually...</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But it would also be great to meet physically and drink a beer together!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It also depends a bit on the release schedule for 3.3. We said we wanted to coordinate with the OWASP confs. If they cancel the AppSecEU in 2020 and do the 2021 conference in February (as planned), then we need a different schedule to stick to
@Walter: What do you mean as release manager?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think there is a big possibility that corona won’t be over by June, so we can’t really plan ahead something physical…</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would say we could keep the current release, and aim for AppSecEU Feb 2021 for the next one?</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think you are right Walter</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey all!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi _@fzipitria_</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So we would rather do a virtual summit in June, not think too much about a physical one in 2020 at all and then meet again next Winter in Dublin?
(Sponsoring plays into this as well: The situation with HQ is very annoying. They have not backed down so far, but it is escalating and eats a lot of time. This and all the other things in my life made it impossible for me to pursue the sponsoring contacts much more. So no progress there.)</span>

**fgs** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi too! I’m not gonna be able to make it today but wanted to drop a hi there!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey, hey _@fgs_! Good to read from you.</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi _@fgs_</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Are you generally still around, or is Corona and your daughter eating you completely?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:56:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Apparently eaten. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:56:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK, so let's get going: Here is our agenda (or the start of it):
[https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues/1733](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues/1733)</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I added a new PR half an hour ago...</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">[1](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/pull/1734)734</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Can you add it to the agenda, please?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ok</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:58:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@walter_ Did you have time to test [#1707](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#1707) in production?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:58:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I’m afraid I haven’t done that yet :disappointed:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:58:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">so that issue remains</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Let's leave it at this then.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I also do not see any progress with 1708.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Or do you see anything there _@airween_?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">nothing relevant - I finished the most part of msc_pcretest :slightly_smiling_face:, as you can see. Now I can start to test the regexes'</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">anyway, just one question</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Go ahead.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think the current PR is right, and fixes all bugs, but the commits (and comments) not so well... Ask _@Allan Boll_ to make a new (and clean) PR? Or just merge this one if it's really done?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">aaaand... with help of msc_pcretest I found a new one bug</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">942130 regex is also vulnerable :disappointed:</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">with all ModSec engine</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">that’s a nightmare</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:confused:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's a neverending nightmare until it will suddenly be over ...</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, but the truth is the PCRE version is too old... the PCRE2 would be even fine</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:05:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">see the bright side: here is a tool which can help for us to avoid these issues... :stuck_out_tongue:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:05:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I love your tool, but we carry a lot of junk it seems.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But back to 1708, do we think this is in a state we can merge (I am no longer sure).</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">no, I think we aren't yet.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:07:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But I can work on it now in more</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:08:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The PR? That would be awsome.
As a side-note: Our amabssador at Azur, Allan Bo, quite Microsoft. Completely ou t of the blue for me. He left his project behind. He also named a new contact, but I did nothave the time to get in touch. This is really a pity. Working with him was great.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:09:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">too bad, he will be missed!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:12:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The last PR by Allan was 1710. This is some very old stuff, that was never ported to 3.0. A problem that is due to the transition back in the day.
Could somebody take a look and merge it?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:13:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I will do that.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You are working on an alternative PR here, _@franbuehler_, are not you?</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:15:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh, that's also mine</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, kind of...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:45:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But anyway. Let's get back to the Agenda: We wanted to migrate the repo on March 18, but TW did not agree on our course of action.
We hoped we could be a complete migration. There is GH functionality for that. Very clean, very thorough. Unfortunately, it also means a 404 at the old location and I kind of understand TW did not want that.
What they want instead is a frozen archive of the old project.
This on the other hand means that we lose issues and PRs; our history if you will.
_@fzipitria_ is testing various ways to get hold of our history and recreate the issues via script. It's a lot of experimenting - and I also think it's worth the time.
I think migrating within the next 2-3 weeks (unconfirmed by TW) is realistic.</span>

**nerrehmit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi guys :wave: I missed the meeting. :sweat_smile:  I really should put an event into my calendar. Gonna catch up on all the stuff you wrote so far</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, it’s really too bad that we have to do this, a full migration of the repo would have been better, as it keeps all the history and even does a clean redirect to the new URL… now we leave the old one, and _@fzipitria_ is busy writing a script to re-create issues and comments</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">it means sadly that the old repo will still be there, and people will probably be going there for a while</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">and create issues and PRs against the now unmaintained old repo</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">but that’s life!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:49:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I guess we should still subscribe the old repo and we can point commenters at the new one</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, we will have to continue to do maintenance there.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Unless they take away our commit rights.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">and TW has the final word on that?</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yeah, there are a lot of scripts etc with auto updating etc... really bad</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:50:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">or it’s a GH privileges problem?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes for a full repository transfer, a user has to have admin rights on SpiderLabs as well as CoreRuleSet organizations</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:51:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">which makes sense!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">but TW is not interested in this option</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:52:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">TW has the final word. And they need to press the button. Our contact refused. We tried to convince her, but the verdict is final. Now we need to do it the complicated way and that takes time (and energy).</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:53:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm glad _@fzipitria_ is very creative with this script. Could you elaborate how you plan to handlethe issues? COuld be interesting for everybody.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">if is there something I could do to help, let me know _@fzipitria_</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sure</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:54:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">even a message full of bad word to TW :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK. Let's go on then.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So HAProxy endorses our project for their enterprise offering.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sorry, was in a call</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:57:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No worries.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:58:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What I'm doing is using the github API to migrate the issues</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:58:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This approach has several problems over just migrating the repo</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:58:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Mainly, everything executes under the user doing the migration</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So every ticket will be with the same face for a long time :smile:</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:59:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Also, if we want to keep comments with all involved people, you need to @someone which will generate a new mention in github</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So there could be a lot of mentions the day we decide to do this migration</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">my god</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">While my tests can reproduce more or less the issues, with PRs is a different story</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:00:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">omg</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm adding them to the comments, so we have a sense on what happened when</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:01:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This is going to be annoying, but we get to take all our issues - open and closed - with us. And I think this is worth it.
But we could also \@somebody, could not we?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I guess we can do that</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:02:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But involves parsing the content</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can share the code and invite whomever wants to add code</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">uhmm, just a dumb question: what about doing the contrary? ask to TW to move the repo and solve all 404 issues with a script?</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What do you mean?</span>

↳ **walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">what do you mean _@theMiddle_? TW won’t move the repo</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:04:43 UTC</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thay "want to keep the history" there.</span>

↳ **walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">they want to keep the historical record intact (and maybe they want to keep it as a bit of leverage in case they want to fork from us…)</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I don't think they have the manpower or will to do that, but you never now</span>

↳ **walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">exactly</span>

↳ **theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes I mean, they don’t want to move because it will makes users unable to find old contents (404), is it right?</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Nope</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ahh ok</span>

↳ **walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:11:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes a real transfer creates a 301 redirect, and even nicer if you try to work with the old repository over git, github will give a very nice notice to use the new URL.. it would have been great, but alas</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:03:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think these mentions could actually be good — everybody will be notified with the new repository location :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It could be too much good for some. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:05:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">and what if we start the new project with new name, eg. CoreRuleSet/owasp-crs, and fork the existing tree from SpriderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs? When TW will be willing to press the button, then we will got the "old" repository - and will keep it as our "old project"? Until we just listen the issues and redirect users to the new project.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This is half a hard fork</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:06:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">With TW cooperation, they can point to the new repo and have the one archived as read-only</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If they don't want to do that, then we have a full hard fork</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:07:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, but only that's what doesn't work</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:09:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Summing things up: We had long discussions with the lady at TW. She is not exactly going out of the way to please us and ideally, she would just have us fork and close the door when we're out.
We are now going to great length to take the issues with us and we think we are almost there with the migration script.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:13:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@theMiddle_ shared an ebook from the HAProxy company which mentions CRS as part of their enterprise offering.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What exactly is this SPOE?</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:24:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think its something like an processing interface</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:25:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">to do a side chain to another application</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:25:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This results into something like the ModSec3 connector? But for ModSec2 and HAProxy?</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:25:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes</span>

**emphazer** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:25:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think so</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:26:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good to know this exists.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:26:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you guys.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:26:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We talked about 3.3 before we started with the agenda. The plan is still to push out 3.3 in mid-June, then?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:26:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes I would recommend that we do that</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I was thinking of RCs around 23 May, 6 June, then release 16 June for instance</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:27:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think it makes a lot of sense. It's just that many things we planned for 3.3 are not ready yet. We either need to postpone / drop them, or time for testing becomes minimal.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:28:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I absolutely want to do the multi-transformation feature. But I need to find a time when to do it.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:28:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes that can be hard, and remember that the repository change will also cause a lot of work</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:28:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">we have to update all our documentation, send out emails, probably answer questions</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:29:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">so maybe it is a bit optimistic, but we can see how this month develops</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:29:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes. Lot of work.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:29:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I feel myself getting into the work from home routine more, and becoming more productive.. first weeks was some kind of shock but now I’ve accepted it</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:30:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So let's see one month from now, confirm your schedule or we re-schedule. I think June makes a lot of sense in the long run. Close to a 9 month schedule, also if we do 3.4 for Dublin next winter.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:31:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I agree it’s best, summer is a bad time for exposure (well, not if everybody is still at home :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:31:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm spending 2-3 hours per day talking to the people doing my construction. And then the home-schooling on top. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:32:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yeah that is crazy, we totally would understand if you can’t put in the CRS hours that you would have liked!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:32:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'll see what I can do.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:33:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Usually we would now talk about ten open issues. But no much has moved on that front (when looking at the issues assigned last month, I think). And honestly we are all a bit exhausted.
Do we can to continue or call it a day and we try and work on issues as time permits?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:34:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would be glad if we call it a day :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:34:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">need some rest!</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:34:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Me too :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:34:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">agree (call it a day)</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:34:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I know on what issues and PRs I can work...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:35:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm usually all for pushing through, but I think we are excused if we stop now.
Thank you everybody for attending and for all your good work!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">20:35:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's a pleasure to work with you.</span>
