**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Meeting time!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Exactly!</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hiho</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Welcome everybody. Who's around?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ciao!</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi there!</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">First I want to thank everybody for the hard work that’s gone into our releases of today!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good to see you all. It's a testimony that this security release did not kill our project. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I feel that everybody brought unique knowledge and work to the table and I hope that I didn’t mess it all up. :see_no_evil:</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks for all the hard work!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You did a very good release, _@walter_. And it is good you made sure we did not rush it.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Honestly, I feel exhausted and worn down.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Me too!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Let’s try to make this chat a fast one.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And I feel like I only contributed minimally - with a lot of other stuff going on. Or with constantly losing the overview - and struggling to find it anew.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I feel the same, but that’s the impostor syndrome. Truly, we all brought very good stuff to the table.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And if it’s not perfect, we will try again!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Certainly.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If at first you don't succeed, publish a patch release.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Let’s hope not :see_no_evil:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Do you guys think it's too early for a lessons-learnt? Or are there any impressions you would want to share?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(release more often? ;))</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we should discuss this at the retreat. And we should definitely touch upon the topic of our release cadence. And also, how far back we are willing to support old versions.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:38:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I’m just saying that because backporting has replaced appendicitis as the worst thing.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:38:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's been brought up before and 4.0 definitely is too long in the making. I get the feeling with the big changes of 4.0 we're in a position to release more regularly.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:38:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think so too.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:39:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What troubled me with the Yahoo Bug Bounty findings is, that nobody really seemed to take / have the lead. So I got a feeling of constantly waiting for somebody.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey :wave:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I will admit that I could have done better, but this happened at the same time my mother was in crisis, I was running two projects because a developer left, and I just couldn’t muster the concentration. The BB was just too much.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think our general approach works nicely, but here it delayed things. We may have to take a more formal approach to security topics.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good point. Maybe someone needs to take the "organisational lead" next time.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The BB was too much in every dimension.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Nevertheless you have done great work communicating with Trustwave, which we know is not your favorite pastime.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There is a risk with somebody being "organisational leader". Everybody else will step onto the sidelines and the work is not longer equally shared.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think I've done a weak job communicating with them. Borderline unprofessional. Delayed and struggling to keep up on a technical level.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Perhaps a bit better with the sponsors, but that's not how I want to work in the future. But then agian, we had structures for 2 findings per weak and then we got 100+. So being overwhelmed and underperforming is no surprise.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Count summer also.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Either way, I think it a good plan to talk project structure during the retreat.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Absolutely</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We are also expanding the project to dev that are not attending our sync chats anymore. So it's harder to keep everybody on the same page. We will need to evolve without risking the good things that we have.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Probably a good thing for discussing on our retreat</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Exactly.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Retreat is a good topic as well.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's about time to set up a schedule and cultural adventures committee, I think.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm a bit behind with writing down the people attending.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Who among you will participate?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'd like too but am yet undecided.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It's not that far _@maxleske_, I think a long weekend again is doable.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We can also share a car to get there.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I have some overtime to compensate, so I think I could come for the full week.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That would be awesome.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Paul said he would like to come as well. _@xanadu_ what are your plans?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'd like to come, but I have a Halloween commitment :jack_o_lantern: I may have to arrive Sunday evening.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@franbuehler_ We're doing the roll call about the dev retreat. Do you join?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@theMiddle_ has prepared a more or less empty dev retreat page that we can fill as we move along.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">[https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/wiki/Dev-Retreat-2022](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/wiki/Dev-Retreat-2022)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@theMiddle_ I presume you will work on the program team. Any other volunteers? _@fzipitria_ you have been quite active in the discussion those recent weeks (-> separate  channel).</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I’m in</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can help to collect some useful info for foreigners (as last year)</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I'll join from Saturday to Wednesday again</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:56:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks _@airween_</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:56:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">and if you need any other things, just let me know</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There are a few open questions around - let's call them - not-so-active-developers, GSoC participants, non-sponsoring partners (like JP Tosso), etc.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:58:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We've been very liberal generous last time.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:58:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That is nice from a project perspective. But it becomes a problem when the very active people think they worked hard and the other ones get it for free. Anybody has any opinion on this?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we should discuss at the retreat how we will deal with the natural flow of developers coming and going, and also the project governance (likely it won’t be us 3 until our pension date)</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If we have capacity for 14 people at the retreat, as long as there is space for the active developers to go, then bringing along more people is a good thing, right?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That is one of the things we need to discuss, also</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It will cost us a little for the tickets I guess, but personally for this time, I would invite as much people as we can, and then discuss the rules for next year.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think it's fine to sponsor a guest, maybe not more than two. I also think that, if one of the core devs would like to come but can't due to financials, then a "sponsored spot" should be used for that.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(I'm not fixed on the "two" by the way, just wanted to have a limit in there)</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yeah, changing the rules (if any) before the retreat might not be fair.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But this is one of the things to discuss clearly by the extended team</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yep! Hope this chat is saved - I already spotted 3 to 4 excellent points for an extended discussion.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you. This adds to the perspective. We'll see if the sponsors want to send people. If they do they might take their own hotel room.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Chats are always saved and archived.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">[https://github.com/coreruleset/project-chat-archive#readme](https://github.com/coreruleset/project-chat-archive#readme)</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We have our our “blockchain” ledger of chats there :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:05:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good, so I can respond positively to everybody with commit rights and then we'll discuss it at the retreat. I think this is better for the project than 1-2 leads sharing rules with individuals in private conversations.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Btw: Status of retreat: It has been approved by the CFO of the OWASP board. The first payment has been requested at last (after approval apparently) and we hope to get it all sorted out in time. But it's hard with OWASP, it really is.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:07:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If we look at the release done today, I think v4 during the retreat is the best outcome. Releasing before is entirely unrealistic, I think. Or does anybody think differently?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:08:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Are we aiming to address all of the bug bounty findings before the v4.0 release?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:08:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Or will that continue after the release?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:08:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I wouldn’t directly say during the retreat, I see it as more likely that we solve a lot of issues but all of them? Not sure.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:09:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Given this chat is public, let's say yes.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:09:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">All relevant (non-informational) findings should be addressed</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:09:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So _@walter_ this points to an RC2 right after the retreat?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:09:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If we solved everything, yes :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:10:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Adressed / solved is a wide field. It depends on the PL...</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:11:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think there will likely be SOME open issues that need more investigation by subteams. But I also think we will be very powerful together, and make hard choices easier. So I think we will have a much higher velocity than commenting on github - waiting two days for reply - etc…</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:11:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Absolutely.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:11:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Which paranoia level? Just show of hands</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:11:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm fine with solving stuff on PL2.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:11:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I also have some PL2 fixes in mind.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:12:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I don't care :smile:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:14:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Honestly, it's a theater to a certain extend. We're fixing false negatives for individual rules while conceptually there will always be false negatives for individual rules. So it's only a question of being informed about them.
One more successful approach could be to take the exploitation risk into consideration - or just how likely it is somebody else will stumble on the bypass.
Which does not mean we should release with know false negatives. I am only thinking aloud.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:16:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anyways, we agree a 4.0 is not imminent and we have to use the dev retreat to work on it.</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:16:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">agree, the exploitation risk in some report is really low, and many of them are not in an "injection context" that makes them really non-realistic</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:17:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But we also must not make it the only topic or we will grow disappointed. I think a good balance has to be found (and I am sure we'll find it). Or would you do an all-in on the findings?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:18:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">(-> there is also the body of SQLi bypasses that _@franbuehler_ is working on - when she is not busy with GSoC.)</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:18:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Great! Bring it! :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:18:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No, that would probably burn morale through the week. I liked having multiple things to do and talk about. It's exciting to see what others whip up in the short time.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:18:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">To be honest, I did not continue with these sqli bypasses.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:19:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">GSoC is finished now, so I'll have more time</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:19:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I see already 4-5 discussion workshops and I wouldn’t mind spending time on rule writing.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:19:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Besides the pool… :sunglasses:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:20:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would love to see the status page project in the same style we saw the sandbox project last time.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:20:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">In case I come, I heard that one slot was already reserved for the "REGEXP-ASSEMBLE WORKSHOP" :sweat_smile:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:20:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">GSoC project Seaweed should also not be forgotten.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:20:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We may want to extend everything to 2 weeks. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:21:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">True. But a ballpark figure, I think probably at least 50-100 hours went into the sandbox after the retreat. It was a great start but required a lot of work afterwards too.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:22:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It was also stress-tested by the BB of course.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:22:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But the status page could also lead to follow-up work. We will be badmouthing some big players. It’s not unthinkable that they will respond with blogs that we will want to refute. Etc.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:22:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Absolutely. Projects like this only  need to get people addicted. Once the ball is rolling we can watch it ...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:23:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The status page is certainly that needs to be approached with very good communication. But we have Alessandro for that as well.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:23:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So I would aim for a good beginning, a good plan, and just maybe a minimal viable product, but with the expectation that work will continue later.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:23:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Absolutely.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:23:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That would be my plan as well. MVPs for the win!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:25:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">A week is not that much, also, and you need time to generate ideas or suddenly realize why the current direction needs to be changed (for me these moments are mostly the shower and the “number 2”s)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:26:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">What is "number 2"s?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:26:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">lol</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:26:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh my. A “number 2” is when you go poopy.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:26:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That legitimately made me laugh out loud :laughing:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:27:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hahahah</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:27:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Can’t believe that is so global</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:27:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ahaha</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:28:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">can't believe that this is archived on github</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:28:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hahahahaha</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:28:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Global minus Switzerland.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:28:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh, yeah. You are neutral.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:28:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Probably is 0 instead of 2.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:28:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">1.5</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:28:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hahahaha</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:29:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK, so now we know where all the bright ideas come from and we can wonder if it has been in the shower or not.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Before this chat takes too long: We have grown from the ideal number of 20+ open issues to 100.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yep… a side effect of our being so overwhelmed..</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This is certainly due to the BB, but it's also really challenging. The closing bot is taking its toll now every week and there are important issues idling...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Last time we "solved" this by introducing the issue chat every month. I'd sincerely hate to do one every week now and I am pretty sure you would not want that either. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I don't think that would help...</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:33:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We have to get back to our old selves, and the only way to do it is to grind on the BB issues, I see no other option</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Not sure we can continue to grind much longer. It's no longer healthy for the project.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:34:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I propose we stop opening new issues for feature requests etc. Or, at least, do not open an issue if you do not intend to work on it?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We shouldn't use the issues list as a "wish list".</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I agree. I’m not sure we should work very hard on the BB now. I would be perfectly fine to recover a bit and get back to it at the retreat.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But this was a long due massive update. Sadly we didn’t choose when to do it.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The BB findings are great. But only in retrospect.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:35:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Pausing a bit and working on other stuff until the retreat as a general direction would be preferable from my perspective.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Same.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I will be on standby for any problems with the release (and possibly a re-release in case of bugs)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:36:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Which does not mean that volunteering on BB is not welcome. But I think we should not ask people to grind.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:37:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Agreed, I don’t think we should grind now, we are too tired. Let’s pick up the BB issues at the retreat again. I’m sure we will feel better and energized again.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes. So rather look through the open issues those next few weeks if there are a few relaxing ones... :tropical_drink:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe prepare a little bit in advance.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Preparing the retreat is always a good option.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:39:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So are there any issues you would want to discuss tonight?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would like everyone to install the new release :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:40:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But AFAIC I’d rather keep the chat as short as possible. Tired…</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:41:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Same here.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you all for joining. Last few weeks have been rough, but it's easier when being part of a great team!</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you all for the hard work!!!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:42:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Absolutely! There were times when I felt lonely, battling with Git and bugs, but I also felt proud because of the amazing achievements that I could simply cherrypick!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:10 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We spent a lot of time on detail. And we took our time, but seeing that Trustwave released only last week, I’m not feeling too bad about it.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:44:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And I am happy that Trustwave still supports the project with our needs. Could have gone otherwise.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Shall we call it a night, then? Mmm.. that couch looks so lovely</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes. Good job everyone!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:46:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good night!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you all!!!!</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Night!</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Let’s go over the wiki for the retreat!</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Bye!</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:16 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">good night!</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good night!!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:47:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh yes. Good point, can someone gather the discussion topics from the chat log?</span>

**theMiddle** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:48:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yep, I can</span>
