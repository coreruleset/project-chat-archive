**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey _@azurIt_, thank you for letting us know.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi _@maxleske_!</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi there!</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello _@airween_ & _@franbuehler_!</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good evening!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi _@xanadu_, nice to see you!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Let's see if _@fzipitria_ is around too. I see _@walter_ coming in.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi everybody! I’m feeling a bit under the weather and hanging behind my desktop is giving me a headache so I will try to hang on but might log off after an hour or so :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good plan. But this will be a fast one, anyways. (keeping my fingers crossed...)</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">maybe an hour is a good aim, good meetings usually take an hour..</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Paul has excused himself too, so I suggest we get started.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Maybe first about Trustwave / ModSecurity.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OWASP HQ is interested to take over ModSecurity from Trustwave who made an announcement they would like to hand over development to "the" open source community. Executive director is being involved himself and our role more an assistance function.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:35:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:wave:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:36:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Lead developer Zimmerle is very much in favor of moving ModSec in the direction of OWASP, but we can not know if Trustwave has other plans. The next few weeks will show.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:37:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If you are interested in the details, then please get in touch with _@walter_ , _@fzipitria_ or me via direct message.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:38:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">With that being said, let's not lose more time and head over to issues. We covered 10 issues last month. 4 of them are now closed, 6 are pending. Several ones are rescheduled for tonight.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:39:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Let's look at [#2142](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#2142). I'm a bit at a loss here. It's complicated and I think we have hit a roadblock. What do we do?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">is there a roadblock, would the latest suggestion not solve it?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">it’s kind of a strange RE</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">and I don’t really understand why the earlier suggestions wouldn’t work :thinking_face:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">almost suspecting a modsec3 bug..</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">A lot of contradicting statements and I have a hard time twisting my head around. A real PR would probably help. But maybe I've not followed closely enough. Pity Azurit is not around tonight.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would say assign to azurit and me and we’ll fry this chicken</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sounds like a plan. Thank you.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Actually the two of you are already assigned.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would say it’s not a very high priority issue, the WP site health page is not super critical for running a WP site</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So if you both continue with this, then we can consider this done for tonight. I would just like to get it off the list. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">[#2179](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#2179) is about backslash escaping inconsistencies that _@xanadu_ discovered. Two PRs exist (2183 + 2201) that are connected with this, if I am not mistaken.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Could be close 2179 in favour of these two PRs, are is there more to 2179 that the two PRs can't solve?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think the two PRs will resolve 2179</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I was planning to re-test everything again to be certain</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think the same</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But I think it is almost there</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good. I'm fine with leaving it open if you want to continue testing stuff. It's just good to know we have a solution and the issue is really addressed. Thank you for your work on this.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">[#2201](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#2201) needs a second person to give it the okay, I think</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And [#2183](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#2183) needs a tweak to one of the modifications, I think</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And then it is finished, I hope :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sounds good. Please get in touch if you can't see a volunteer reviewer on these issues. Otherwise we'll assign somebody at the October chat at the latest.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">[#2167](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#2167): This has been lingering, Walter proposes to expand the WP REs a big deal during the retreat. I'm not convinced. So little interest from the WP community to support us in this direction.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">well we are running a LOT of wordpress sites, it’s part of my day job to create these exclusions, so for me keeping up-to-date with API changes is part of the day job and I’d love to upstream more of it</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">but, I’m flexible in how we want to proceed</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But would you also want to do this for many additional plugins. Do you use all the top plugins or would you simply add REs for those where you do the work anyways?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Azurit seems to use these plugins as well. So he could contribute as well if he's interested.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:52:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">we could make a wishlist of plugins and it’s usually pretty easy to ‘exercise’ them and have them make all their calls</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">in any case, the offer stands to significantly expand the RE</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Could this be a side-project that is being launched after we made the RE packages plugins?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:47 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The issue of 2167 is a PUT request that is kind of an exception when we usually don't allow PUT. So solving 2167 means we need to override the list of permitted http methods. Doing that is more welcome in a plugin than in an official CRS release... :wink:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">agreed</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:56:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think we do it also for next cloud so there is precedent</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:56:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:56:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ah, I was not aware of that.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:56:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thanks.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So the course of action could be:
</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes!</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:58:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">maybe a little survey on the modsec mailinglist to identify plugins that are not on my radar (but perhaps they should have, say, 100.000 installs)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:58:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Think so too.</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">after all there are a LOT of plugins and a lot of them are bad too</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The modsec ML is just a very slow place. But maybe that combined with twitter and possibly also a  blog post...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anyways, good to see we have a plan here now. And given you are assigned to 2167 already, we can expect a PR soon. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">good idea!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Next one: [#2187](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#2187).</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">dev-on-duty has to repeat him-/her-self a lot. The documented 4 cases would probably be enough to address 80% of the questions / issues. So we want to prepare some default responses (in the wiki). That could then be copied / pasted / adjusted and save some time.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">All we need now is somebody to write a these 4 responses as a draft. I'd be happy to refine and finish them, but a draft would help me get going. And it's also better if there are more than 2 eyes working on this. Any volunteer?</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:02:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">not all at once :blush: </span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We'll. Maybe need to get going myself here, nevertheless. :slightly_smiling_face: Nevermind.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:58 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I can write drafts. Shouldn't be too much work.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you _@maxleske_. I agree. And thank you.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The target audience would be Stackoverflow or similar, correct</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:05:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Primarily GH issues, but then SO and the like. SO questions tend to be more diverse, though.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:05:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anyways. Let's move on to [#2171](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#2171). This is the FP in question: (Condensing this was quite a bit of work ...)

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I just need the time!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:19:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That is correct. This issue is a tricky one.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:20:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK, maybe best to leave this in your capable hands then.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:20:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Which brings us to [#1943](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/#1943), which has been open for quite some time.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:21:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@maxleske_ and _@franbuehler_ have been working on these cyrillic letters. If we're lucky this is solved already, I did not check.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:22:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This is an other rule, not 941130, unfortunately...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:22:13 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Too bad. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:22:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">oh you are right! this is
941120</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:22:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I was not sure if you had worked on more than one.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:22:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">O I did not see that people tagged me in the issue, sorry for that!!</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:23:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ah these encoding issues are so painful</span>

**walter** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:23:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">`ONB =We could workaround this perhaps by being less strict, onXXX= event handlers will usually require more letters, so why would onB= match</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:23:56 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That looks really weird... I'll self assign and take a look too. I have some experience with encoding issues</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:24:06 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, they really are. Or rather: We have regex nerds that know no pain when it comes to regexes, but we have yet to find an encoding afficionado.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:24:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Thank you _@maxleske_!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:25:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">This was the list of issues I put on the agenda... Anything else you want to cover? There are two new issues, just in case...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:28:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good. If there is nothing else, then I suggest we close this for tonight.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:30:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Absolutely. A meeting without notes never happened.</span>
