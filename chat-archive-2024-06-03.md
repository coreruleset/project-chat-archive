**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:30:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi there!</span>

**jit** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi everyone. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hi</span>

**Esad Cetiner** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello :blob-wave:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:31:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Our agenda is at: [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3728](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3728)</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Evening</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I only just copied over the agenda.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:32:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Newest entry is the registration for the OWASP community summit.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">In fact the shop is online but still under review by [pretix.eu](http://pretix.eu). Since we are formally a new organizer (OWASP CRS vs OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set).</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:33:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I presume it will be publicly accessible tomorrow morning European time.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We're meeting in the Hyatt Regency right next to the OWASP conference. It took us (-> me) far too long to get a location, but I had to many other unpleasant things to deal with. Sorry.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I still hope a few people outside of _@fzipitria_ and myself will be there. We also do not have that much of a program so far.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:34:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Like 4 talks set. So this could take us until 3 / 4pm. We could definitely do with another 2-3 talks.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:38:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I like the list of tutorials and other new guides for CRS integration in the "outside development" section of the agenda. Thanks - whoever added this. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:39:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You're welcome :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">hi everyone</span>

**Matteo Pace** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hello!</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:40:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I have a question about the last entry, where they use this NGINX by Ondrej PPA.
I have in mind that there were problems with this. Or did I get this wrong?</span>

↳ **maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I think _@airween_ remembers issues with that PPA and some bad dependencies.</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yeah, there were some PCRE issue</span>

↳ **franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, and as a result the CRS always blocked. If yes, should we respond to this?</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ondrey likes to use his own PCRE package (because of the PHP)</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">why do you need to use that?</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I mean that PPA</span>

↳ **franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It was mentioned in a blog post and I'm a bit afraid people use this and then we get reports.</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ah, I see, thanks</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Hey guys, we're only getting started.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I think _@airween_ remembers issues with that PPA and some bad dependencies.</span>

↳ **maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:41:38 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, I think _@airween_ remembers issues with that PPA and some bad dependencies.</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:03 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yeah, there were some PCRE issue</span>

↳ **franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, and as a result the CRS always blocked. If yes, should we respond to this?</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ondrey likes to use his own PCRE package (because of the PHP)</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:51 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">why do you need to use that?</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I mean that PPA</span>

↳ **franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:55:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It was mentioned in a blog post and I'm a bit afraid people use this and then we get reports.</span>

↳ **airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:43 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">ah, I see, thanks</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We believe that the Ondrej PPA is responsible for the very strange errors we've seen reported over the past 2 years. E.g. "200 is not a number" and very odd things like that.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We've had, I think, 4 separate reports.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:42:53 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, exactly. And everything was blocked. Should we react to this blog post and how? Because it could lead to strange reports on our side again.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:43:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Or maybe we just wait for reports and then we know where the problem is and what to answer :joy:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Is there a contact address?
Alternatively, a brief blog post explaining the situation might help. We could then close issues with reference to this blog post.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:44:22 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">And if the situation changes, update the blog post.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:12 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">as I remember once _@azurit_ wrote that the guy is a very sensitive person, be careful with the report...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:45:30 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oh, oh.</span>

**franbuehler** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:46:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes. there is the author of this blog post. Not himself.
But a blog post written by CRS and then link to it would be more defensive. I like that :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:47:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Would anybody like to do this?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:48:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I see more interest in reading said blog post. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:49:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Please open an issue for the blog post somebody, so it's at least not forgotten...</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:08 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Other than that and with regards to the rules: I would like to highlight the fact that thanks to several people combing the open issues, we're down to 72.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:50:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">As you might remember we were at 109 peak or so. And needless to say that the low 22 we had reached before the bug bounty was a very, very feeling (Oh, the joys of fitting all github issues on a single page!)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:51:46 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I have been contributing very little to this effort for personal reasons, but please don't do as I do here. It's really very important and very useful work. By cleaning the table we make room for new initiatives.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:53:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">For CRS devs, and still covering the various sub-projects, _@azurit_'s creation of security issue R9V is rather a biggie. We will spend quite a bit of work on this. Maybe it takes a separate task force to attack this.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:54:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">You looked into this as well _@maxleske_, did not you? And you too _@airween_? What is your opinion on the subject? (Without giving away the details please)</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:56:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, it's bad. But it's also not a new thing, the issue has existed from the beginning, if I'm not mistaken. Mostly, the fix should be easy, but it will take some work to verify the fix.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:57:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_"What is your opinion on the subject?"_ - sorry to ask the clarification, "subject" -> sub-projects to solve R9V issue?</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:20 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I helped _@azurit_ to confirm the issue on both Apache and Nginx. Yes, this issue is very weird, and we have to care that.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">18:59:41 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Repeating myself: What we lack in this area is a systematic approach and a clear guideline. So it's all a bit try and error.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Btw is that something what Andrea reported once?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No, similar, but not quite, unless I am mistaken.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:00:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We also have other issues we need to fix in the private repo</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:11 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">NEWS: CRS Community Summit Registration has just been allowed to go online: [https://pretix.eu/owasp-crs/community-summit-2024/](https://pretix.eu/owasp-crs/community-summit-2024/)
Please register!</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:01:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes, there are additional ones, but at least I do not see them as this problematic. But it might be only me of course.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:02 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_"This is the registration for the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set Community"_ - just a side note: haven't we agreed that we leave the word "ModSecurity" from our project name?</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:28 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yeah, and the logo looks "old"</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:31 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Anyway</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:03:39 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Oops. Also the logo. But I tried to be fast with cloning the old one. Give me a minute.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:04:32 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Fixed the text, will look into logo after the meeting.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:06:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK to advance in the agenda?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:07:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">There is the open question if we can merge two of the local data files.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:08:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Did anybody run the tests on this? I'm aware a lot of it is redundant. Would merging the rules be a natural next step too?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:09:17 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Sounds like a reasonable idea, but I have not looked at it. What would be the benefit at the moment, given that we have a lot of other stuff on our plate already?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:10:04 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I guess it's about the unwanted redundancy. But I did not check it out in detail.</span>

**Esad Cetiner** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:11:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It would be a bit easier to maintain, and improve detection slightly. There could be risk of false positives, but everything I'm seeing doesn't look that false positive prone.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:12:40 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If someone takes the initiative, providing a comprehensive PR with some statistics and tests then why not. Otherwise I'd try to focus our energy on areas that we know need more care.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:14:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I do not like the redundancy, but I do like to be able to handle the different rules a bit differently. Once we merge, the single data file has to fit multiple rules.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:14:59 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Other opinions.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:15:18 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">?</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:15:37 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm with the same. If there is something to add by doing this, I'm up for it.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:16:00 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Right now I'm thinking that for doing an LTS release, we still need to cleanup the **RESPONSE** files</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:16:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So if we want to invest time, that's a better place right now</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:16:27 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">That will be much better once I merge the platform overrides PR.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:16:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Agreed</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:17:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">OK. Next on the agenda: issue [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2127](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/2127)</span>

↳ **fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:29:44 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I think this was left from the previous month agenda.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:18:26 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@azurit_ volunteered to attack this. But he has been very active on different fronts in the meantime.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:18:52 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm not sure what we need to discuss here (nor who added it to the agenda).</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:19:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">:shrug:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:19:57 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">_@fzipitria_?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:22:21 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">It seems there is nothing to talk here. So let's move over to issue [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3297](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3297)</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:23:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So this is what ultimately lead to R9V. Am I right if I assume that fixing R9V will also bring a fix for this group of broken tests?</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:24:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Yes</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:24:14 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">yes, definitely</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:24:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">So nothing to talk to here, I guess.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:24:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">btw it's interesting why this test was succes previously (or was it at least ever?)</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:25:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The test is successful because the expectation of the rule is wrong. :shrug:</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:27:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">The test condition of the test is actually wrong.</span>

**airween** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:27:29 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">oh, I see, thanks</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:27:34 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Good. Let's move over to [https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3239](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3239)</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:28:01 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I closed that one today</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:28:05 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No need to talk it over</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:28:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Ah, cool. I was wondering ... :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:28:36 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Last formal item on the agenda: Idea to rename go-ftw to Waft, Westy, Wtf ...</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:29:19 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Given _@xanadu_'s comment, `waft` is off the table I think :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:29:33 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Too bad, yes.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:29:55 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But you really feel you need a new name, also now that we established the original name?</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:30:15 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Again, I do not think it's overly important, but at least a few people know this one.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:30:48 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Well, the prefix `go-` is just something we don't need. It was for showing a different repo name that the original `ftw`</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:30:54 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">No, it's not important, but if I have the control, I like to have nice names for my tools :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:09 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">But sadly we cannot substitute one repo over the other</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:23 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Makes sense _@maxleske_.</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">crs-ftw to match crs-toolchain?</span>

**xanadu** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:49 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">If go- is the problematic part</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:31:50 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Naming is hard. Indeed.</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:24 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I would say let's write it somewhere else if needed, don't waste too much time now.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:35 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I mean we can always spend a day or two at the next retreat on this question ...</span>

**fzipitria** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:32:42 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">We can create an issue in the `go-ftw` repo and see what others have to say</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Speaking of: How hot is the CRS renaming question for you at the moment? We kind of postponed the decision for a year. Half a year has passed. I feel that I have warmed up to the LA7R idea (this was it, I think).</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:38:25 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Currently, I don't see the urgent need to rename. We made a decision and I think it's enough to revisit it at the retreat. And I don't think we have found the best name yet.</span>

**maxleske** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:07 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Plugins can now define which backends they want to test against. We needed this to exclude nginx for the body decompression plugin, which currently only works on v2.</span>

**dune73** <span style="color: grey; font-size: 90%;">19:43:45 UTC</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">I saw this and it's super cool. How do you define this?</span>
